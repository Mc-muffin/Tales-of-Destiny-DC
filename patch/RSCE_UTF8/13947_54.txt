[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
Who are you!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, you guys aren't from
Calvalese are you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, how did you know?
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena
[ENDBLOCK]
I can tell at a glance.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
Damned foreigners!
Get out of my house!
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
It's bad enough that you're in
my city, now you're trying to
take Elena away!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Eh, what's going on?
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor's Wife
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sorry if we offended you,
but now is not a good time...
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
They're the ones who
should be apologizing!
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena
[ENDBLOCK]
Grandma, Grandpa, stop it!
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena
[ENDBLOCK]
If these people can't
be here, then what 
about me...?
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
Fine! Whatever! Do
what you want!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Um, excuse me,
but what was 
that about...?
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena
[ENDBLOCK]
You see, half of my blood
is the same as yours.
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena
[ENDBLOCK]
My mother's from Calvalese and
my father from Seinegald.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I get it now. So where
are your parents?
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena
[ENDBLOCK]
My mother died of an illness a
long time ago. My father is...
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right! I know this is sudden,
but I need a favor from you guys.
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena
[ENDBLOCK]
I think my father is still alive
and probably in Seinegald.
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena
[ENDBLOCK]
If you ever see him,
tell him this.
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena
[ENDBLOCK]
Tell him that his daughter Elena
wants to live with him.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hm? Well, sure.
We can do that.
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sick of this. I hate
my grandparents!
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena
[ENDBLOCK]
All they say is that those with
foreign blood can't be trusted.
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena
[ENDBLOCK]
Whenever grandpa sees someone
from Seinegald, he just sees my
father, who he hates!
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena
[ENDBLOCK]
He also blames father for my
mother's death... even though
it wasn't his fault...
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena
[ENDBLOCK]
The fact that I'm related to
those two makes me sick!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you really feel
that way...?
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sorry. I know it's
not your problem.
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena
[ENDBLOCK]
If you ever meet my father, though,
please remember what I told you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena
[ENDBLOCK]
His name is Nash.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
Nash...! What are YOU doing here!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena
[ENDBLOCK]
Father!
[ENDBLOCK]
Nash
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena...
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena
[ENDBLOCK]
I knew you'd come! Take me
back to Seinegald with-
[ENDBLOCK]
Nash
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena... I can't do that.
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena
[ENDBLOCK]
...What?
[ENDBLOCK]
Nash
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena, you're not going
to be happy with me.
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena
[ENDBLOCK]
Wh-What? Father... you don't blame
yourself for mother, too, do you?
[ENDBLOCK]
Nash
[ENDBLOCK]
It's the truth.
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena
[ENDBLOCK]
No, it's not! You had
nothing to do with-
[ENDBLOCK]
Nash
[ENDBLOCK]
Being married to someone from
Seinegald caused your mother
to be treated so horribly...
[ENDBLOCK]
Nash
[ENDBLOCK]
So if you come stay with me, I fear
you'll have the same treatment.
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena
[ENDBLOCK]
So, if I go to Seinegald...
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
If we Calvalesians were to go,
we'd meet with a much worse fate.
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena
[ENDBLOCK]
Grandpa...?
[ENDBLOCK]
Nash
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sorry, father-in-law.
I've caused you both
nothing but hardship.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't worry about it.
I did it all for her.
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena
[ENDBLOCK]
All for... me?
[ENDBLOCK]
Nash
[ENDBLOCK]
In order for you to be happy...
you had to hate the Seinegaldians.
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena
[ENDBLOCK]
So... everything up to now...
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena
[ENDBLOCK]
...Well, I can tell you,
that plan failed.
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena
[ENDBLOCK]
It's nonsense to hate your
family just because of
where they're from!
[ENDBLOCK]
Nash
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena...
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena
[ENDBLOCK]
I like both Calvalesians
and Seinegaldians.
[ENDBLOCK]
Nash
[ENDBLOCK]
I couldn't leave this
country without you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Nash
[ENDBLOCK]
Somehow, I've managed to get a job
at the Oberon Corp. Cherik branch.
[ENDBLOCK]
Nash
[ENDBLOCK]
You can't live with me yet, but I'd
be happy to come and see you
once in a while, if that's all right.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor's Wife
[ENDBLOCK]
Of course it is.
Right, dear?
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
Of course. You are my son, even though
you're technically my son-in-law...
[ENDBLOCK]
Nash
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you... so much.
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm going to visit you too. With
Grandma and Grandpa, okay?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Maybe we should go now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, let's.

[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm the mayor of this city.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
It's my mission to rid our city
of all these damn foreigners!
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
It's truly Seinegaldian to enter
a man's home this late at night!
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
You have no business here.
Get the hell out of here!
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
You're dressed like... a foreigner!
Don't you dare come into my house!
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
The truly gifted, the chosen
ones... That's what we
Calvalesian people are!
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
After a thousand years of hard
work, our time has finally come!
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you saying that we can't become
inhabitants of the new world...?
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
In case you haven't noticed, I
absolutely despise foreigners.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
You can have the lens.
When you're done, get
the hell out of here.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor's Wife
[ENDBLOCK]
People in this country are poor,
but we all help each other get by.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor's Wife
[ENDBLOCK]
It's a virtue of the Calvalese to be
compassionate to their fellow man.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor's Wife
[ENDBLOCK]
Come on, you'd better
get out of here.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor's Wife
[ENDBLOCK]
What happened to Seinegald?
What's Belcrant?
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor's Wife
[ENDBLOCK]
Are the rumors of Junkland's
disappearance true?
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor's Wife
[ENDBLOCK]
The truth is, it was my husband who was the
most enthusiastic about collecting lens.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character
parameters that can be set. 
The specific method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, press <Square_ani> to 
change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen will be
[Titles]. Press <Triangle_ani> to pick from
all acquired titles.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Titles serve two purposes:
The first is to [affect dialogue 
when talking to NPCs].
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Set a title to have certain NPCs interested
while passing them. When talking with NPCs
multiple times you may get different responses.
Change the title and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to certain NPCs, a [?] will 
appear over the character's head. If this 
happens, set a title that seems to be related
to the dialogue, and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose for titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
