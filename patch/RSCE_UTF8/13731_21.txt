[ENDBLOCK]
Vrooooom~!
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey now! How many times
do I have to tell you! Don't
run around in the house!
[ENDBLOCK]
Only Son
[ENDBLOCK]
It's fiiiine! I'm the Draconis!
I'm flying all over the world~!
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
Sorry about my son. He
didn't hurt you, did he?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm fine. He handles the
rudders really well~
[ENDBLOCK]
Only Son
[ENDBLOCK]
Hehe~ Big bro
gets it!
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
He's such a lively
little rascal!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
All right then! Big bro is the
latest model of the Draconis!
[ENDBLOCK]
Only Son
[ENDBLOCK]
Hehe!! An imposter can't hold
a candle to the real thing!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Draconis 2.0 ready
for liftoff!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Vroooooom~!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, by the way, wasn't
the entire existence of
the Draconis completely
classified by the army?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's correct. But by
this point it doesn't
really matter.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh, I wonder if that's
really the case?
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
Um... excuse me, but are you
members of the military?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm not, but you're right
about this guy.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm really sorry about that.
You see, my husband is part
of the Draconis' crew.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
Before everything happened,
he carelessly told our son
about the Draconis.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
He's off traveling the world 
now, so he doesn't get to 
come home very often.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
And since he's so lonely,
he's started acting like
he's the Draconis.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
I think he wants to travel
alongside his father.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
So could you please not
tell the military we know
about the Draconis?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, it's fine. But
the Draconis is...
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Aaah, that was
so fun!!
[ENDBLOCK]
Only Son
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, hey, mom! This guy said
he rode on the Draconis!
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
Is that so? These people
are soldiers, after all.
[ENDBLOCK]
Only Son
[ENDBLOCK]
Really? Then, do
they know dad?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Your dad? Heh...
what does he do?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
We don't have the time to
play around like this!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Come on, we're
leaving. Now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
See you later~!
[ENDBLOCK]
Only Son
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, come
by again!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What was that? That was pretty
unexpected, even for you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmph. They haven't received
the death notice yet.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
If we were to share that information,
it would surely lead to a court martial.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
My son misses
his father...
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
My husband has been away
at work for some time now.
I'm starting to worry.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
I've been asking the military
about my husband, they won't
tell me anything...
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
Even in a world like this, I feel
I can make it if I have my family.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
Please do your best.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
Please do your best.
[ENDBLOCK]
Only Son
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm tired of waiting for
my dad to come home!
[ENDBLOCK]
Only Son
[ENDBLOCK]
My father hasn't come
home for a long time.
What's wrong with him?
[ENDBLOCK]
Only Son
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, where's Dad?
[ENDBLOCK]
Only Son
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm happy my
Daddy's here!
[ENDBLOCK]
Only Son
[ENDBLOCK]
Good luck,
big brothers!
[ENDBLOCK]
Only Son
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, big sisters!
Good luck!
[ENDBLOCK]
Only Son
[ENDBLOCK]
Good luck,
big brothers!
[ENDBLOCK]
Only Son
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, big sisters!
Good luck!

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character
parameters that can be set. 
The specific method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, press <Square_ani> to 
change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen will be
[Titles]. Press <Triangle_ani> to pick from
all acquired titles.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Titles serve two purposes:
The first is to [affect dialogue 
when talking to NPCs].
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Set a title to have certain NPCs interested
while passing them. When talking with NPCs
multiple times you may get different responses.
Change the title and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to certain NPCs, a [?] will 
appear over the character's head. If this 
happens, set a title that seems to be related
to the dialogue, and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose for titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
