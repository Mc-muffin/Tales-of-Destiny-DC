[ENDBLOCK]
Good morning, Master <Dymlos>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wh-What the?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wait, this is...! <Stahn>,
no! Don't touch that!

<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Doesn't look like it's stopping.
What's gonna happen?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hehe, just watch, <Rutee>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Eh?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, NO!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
So this is where our other
selves will be born...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, so it seems. It's...
quite sad, isn't it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
We're able to be together
like this, but...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
Even though they will live
forever, they won't be able
to have what we have...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're right. A life where I
cannot feel your warmth is
one that I cannot imagine.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
We should enjoy the time we
have together... For our
Swordian's sakes, as well.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, <Dymlos>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
...What was that?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Nothing! It was nothing!
You've got it all wrong!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, come now, <Dymlos>. You don't
have to deny it like that!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
So... This is an old recording
of you and <Dymlos>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right, <Stahn>. Seems
one of our colleagues took
the liberty of recording it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Why!? Why did this have
to come up now...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, this is nice, though! It's a
memory of your time together!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I think I heard a smooch at
the end. What happened
after that?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, <Rutee>... If you must know...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
O-Oh right, that reminds me, <Stahn>.
I remember hiding one of my most
prized possessions near here!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Come on, come on, let's go get it!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Uh, okay, sure.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
When he was a human, <Dymlos>
was a truly passionate man...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Heh, he seemed real embarrassed
that <Stahn> saw that side of him!

The Swordian R&D Lab?

Yes, we Swordians
were created here!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you see the six
chambers in the back?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Our original masters stood in
those chambers, and imprinted
their personalities onto us!
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Has it really been a thousand
years since then...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>

Swordian Engineer?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right. He was an
absolutely brilliant mind.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Kind of unpredictable, though. You
never knew what he'd do next...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Master <Lion>. Hold me up to

[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you gonna be okay?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't worry about me. I'm

[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes. Let's hope it works properly.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>, go to that control panel.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
All right.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
It doesn't appear to be broken. Well,
   that's the first hurdle passed.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's get started.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
First, place us Swordians in
   each of the chambers.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay, got it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ghhaaa!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
Aaaahh!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
Urrghhh!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Igtenos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Agh...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
  Do not shut it down!
Leave it at this output!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
A-All right...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are they going to be okay?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't know. Guess we'll
have to wait and see.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hang in there, Swordians!
We're counting on you!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>, are you all right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
I am. It seems to have worked, somehow.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
Our physical enhancements are complete.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You don't look any
different, though...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Igtenos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Maybe, but on the inside...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Igtenos>
[ENDBLOCK]
The rigidity of our blades, our energy
   conversion efficiency, everything
 about us has been greatly improved.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
All right...! Guess
we're next, huh?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right. As soon as you are ready,
  you may enter the chambers with us.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
Once we begin, our consciousness will
 be taken to a place between worlds.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
That is where we will face our final test.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
What happens if we fail?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Igtenos>
[ENDBLOCK]
You'll never wake up again.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
You won't physically die, but your
consciousness will be lost forever.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
That might as well be dying. So
we've only got one shot at this...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, you said you wanted to be
more like my former master, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Forget about that. If you continue
  with that mindset, you will fall.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's not enough to be like him! That's
 not enough! You must surpass him!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Got it!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's time. Everybody, enter a chamber.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>...
Turn it on.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sure you guys will be fine.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're definitely coming back.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Good luck!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, here we go!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
King <Woodrow>,
are you okay!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Can you understand me, <Rutee>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hang in there, <Philia>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, looks like you
made it in one piece.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You can tell?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah. You look different. I feel
overwhelmed by your aura!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you for your concern, everyone.
It seems we've reached our goal.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
We weren't fighting
by ourselves.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
The thought of you all praying for
our success gave us the strength
we needed to face this trial.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
My prayers were
answered! Hooray!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well... We beat the trial, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right. You've done well.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
All right! Let's get
going, then!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran> won't beat us this time!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's the spirit, <Stahn>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I feel like we could
do anything, now!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah! I bet we could even
break the Eye of Atamoni!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, that's still beyond your reach.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey! Don't bring the mood down!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
 You're getting carried away!
Still just as careless as ever...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ugh, I knew you were
gonna scold me!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You know, we're a pretty
odd bunch, huh?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
A big ol' group of twelve people...
Every single one of 'em weird.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh? Who says I'm weird!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Heh, you're the
weirdest of us all.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, now that we've got our
groove back, how about we
head to our next destination?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, let's.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I believe we were headed
to Junkland, in Calvalese.

Titles are one of the character
parameters that can be set. 
The specific method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, press <Square_ani> to 
change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]

<TAG_007>At the top of this screen will be
[Titles]. Press <Triangle_ani> to pick from

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Titles serve two purposes:
The first is to [affect dialogue 
when talking to NPCs].
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Set a title to have certain NPCs interested
while passing them. When talking with NPCs
multiple times you may get different responses.
Change the title and try talking to them again.

Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to certain NPCs, a [?] will 
appear over the character's head. If this 
happens, set a title that seems to be related
to the dialogue, and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose for titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!

up one you like, so you can set it on
