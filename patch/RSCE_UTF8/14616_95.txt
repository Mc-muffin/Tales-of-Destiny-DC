<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What is that thing?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>Excellent. That's the Aeth'er Cruiser
we've been searching for.
[ENDBLOCK]
???
[ENDBLOCK]
Hold, if you please.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you an Oberon executive?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rembrandt>
[ENDBLOCK]
The name is Shane <Rembrandt>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rembrandt>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've met some of you before
at Master <Hugo>'s mansion.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
So that's where...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rembrandt>
[ENDBLOCK]
There is a guest in that vessel.
An important guest entrusted to
me by the Young Master.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rembrandt>
[ENDBLOCK]
I must request you
give up the cruiser.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You mean <Marian>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
How can you call her a guest when
you've taken her hostage?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rembrandt>
[ENDBLOCK]
She's still a guest, regardless
of the circumstances.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Mr. <Rembrandt>! Why 
are you doing this?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rembrandt>
[ENDBLOCK]
Master <Hugo>'s desires are mine as
well. I hope that answer is enough.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
So, a blind follower.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
I think you're crazy, man.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rembrandt>
[ENDBLOCK]
Say what you will, but I will not
tolerate any more interference.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
We have to rescue the
hostage. <Chelsea>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, sir!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rembrandt>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rembrandt>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Master <Hugo>'s desires aren't
the sole reason I fought you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rembrandt>
[ENDBLOCK]
You see, I'm a parent myself.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Could it be...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rembrandt>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>, whom you killed in
Helraios, was my daughter.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
No way...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rembrandt>
[ENDBLOCK]
Sorry, <Ilene>... I couldn't
avenge you...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rembrandt>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, keep your spirits up.
We ain't done nothing wrong.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
The hostage has been rescued!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's go, <Stahn>. We've 
got work to do, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, you're right...
Thanks, <Kongman>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
No sweat.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm glad you're okay, <Marian>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you all for your help.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
So, um... Emi-, I mean
<Lion>, is he...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion> is...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center><Stahn>, you... Are you going to
tell this woman the truth?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...<Lion> had other things to do.
We're not together right now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is that right...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, but! He's fine. I'm
sure he's doing fine...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
I hope <Lion> didn't choose the
wrong path because of me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Uh...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
In his eyes, I closely resembled
his dead mother.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've heard that I'm a lot
like... his mother, Chris.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Such a person as myself could
become a weakness for him.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
I couldn't help but worry that
he would lose his way because 
of me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Before that could happen,
I thought it might be better
to take my own life...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...<Lion> knew exactly
what he was doing.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
He...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
He did the right thing because he
cared about us, and about you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
So don't tell me you're gonna
die. ...For his sake.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
I understand...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
*crying*
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't cry, <Chelsea>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
I know, I know.
But... but...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's send <Marian> to the surface.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>There's an escape pod here.
You might want to use it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay. <Marian>, come
over here.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you so much
for everything.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Sorry if I'm wrong, but
are you... <Stahn>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, I thought so...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
I had heard a lot about you from
Master <Lion>. You two must have
been very close.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Yeah. He's my
best friend.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sure Master <Lion> will
be pleased to hear that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Um, <Marian>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, sir?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What are you going to do when
you get back to Earth?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Of course, I'll be awaiting <Lion>'s
return at the mansion.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's what we, the servants,
are supposed to do.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now... if you'll excuse me...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
This was ...good, wasn't it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Yeah.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...All right.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Finally, all that's left is Dycroft.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Get the cruiser and neutralizers
ready. Let's go now!

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character
parameters that can be set. 
The specific method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, press <Square_ani> to 
change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen will be
[Titles]. Press <Triangle_ani> to pick from
all acquired titles.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Titles serve two purposes:
The first is to [affect dialogue 
when talking to NPCs].
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Set a title to have certain NPCs interested
while passing them. When talking with NPCs
multiple times you may get different responses.
Change the title and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to certain NPCs, a [?] will 
appear over the character's head. If this 
happens, set a title that seems to be related
to the dialogue, and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose for titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>[Rock Rally] is a game in which
