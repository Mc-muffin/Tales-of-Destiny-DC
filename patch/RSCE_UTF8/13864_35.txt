[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
You look the part, are
you adventurers too?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>

Ah, yes.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
If that's the case, would
you have a look at this?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
What is this?
[ENDBLOCK]
Adventurer
[ENDBLOCK]
An adventurer friend of mine
sent me this picture.
[ENDBLOCK]
Adventurer
[ENDBLOCK]
Somehow, other adventurer friends
of mine have been sending me photos
that look exactly like this one.
[ENDBLOCK]
Adventurer
[ENDBLOCK]
If there is any meaning to these
pictures, it's totally beyond me.
[ENDBLOCK]
Adventurer
[ENDBLOCK]
If you have time, would you go
look around for this place?
[ENDBLOCK]
Adventurer
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't know where it could be, so
use this picture as a reference.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, sure.
[ENDBLOCK]
Adventurer
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll be here for a little while
longer, should you need to
see the picture again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Adventurer
[ENDBLOCK]
One last thing. If you find anything
in this place, tell me. I'll make it
worth your while.
[ENDBLOCK]
Adventurer
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll also be sure to tell my friends
about you. They're the ones who
sent me these photographs.
[ENDBLOCK]
Adventurer
[ENDBLOCK]
The three of them are currently in
Cyril, Straylize Temple, and Shiden.
[ENDBLOCK]
Adventurer
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, buddy. Are
you <Stahn>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh, yes...
[ENDBLOCK]
Adventurer
[ENDBLOCK]
Recently, another adventurer asked
you to look at a photograph, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
Adventurer
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm the friend that sent
him the photograph.
[ENDBLOCK]
Adventurer
[ENDBLOCK]
If you want to see the picture
again, just come and see me.
[ENDBLOCK]
Adventurer
[ENDBLOCK]
Look at the picture again?
Yes
No
[ENDBLOCK]
Adventurer
[ENDBLOCK]
I see, so that's
what happened.
[ENDBLOCK]
Adventurer
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Adventurer
[ENDBLOCK]
Here's your reward.
Please take it.
[ENDBLOCK]
Adventurer
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll take my leave
now. See you.
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll refer you to my friends, the
ones who took the pictures.
[ENDBLOCK]
They are in Cyril, Straylize
Temple, and Shiden.
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll refer you to my friends, the

<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>, thank you for your
hard work escorting the
Bishop here the other day.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
It was nothing. Is the temple
reconstruction going well?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, it is.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
...At least, that's what
I want to say. We still
have a lot of problems...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Above all else, the
biggest issue is...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
...The fact that the Eye of Atamoni
will no longer be housed here.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I thought that the existence
of the Eye of Atamoni was
a strict secret?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, that's the problem.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
There are some in the higher ranks
who see it as the sole reason for
the temple's very existence.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
What do you mean?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is just one theory, but...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's possible that this temple was
built specifically to protect the
Eye of Atamoni.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is that true?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Even I don't know
for sure.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Indeed, I don't think
anyone does.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Still, this has become a problem
that has shaken the temple to
its very core...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
If this keeps up, then...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
What will you do?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh? Me?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, what do you
think about this?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you someone who wants to help
people by protecting the temple?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Or someone who wants to help the
temple by protecting other people?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I... I just...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I just believe that Atamoni
exists within the hearts of
the people... That it gives
them the strength to live...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, in that case, it doesn't
matter what the others think.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Tell me, who told you
to say all of that?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wh-What!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Nobody! I'm speaking
my own mind, here!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hehehe! Thank you...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
In that case, I'll just have
to keep my chin up!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
If someone I didn't know
said that to me...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
...I'm not sure it would have
cheered me up so much.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmph... Whatever you say...

Everyone wants to travel in
search of freedom at least
once in their life.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, it looks like you're
enjoying your freedom.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't get me wrong, it's fun to
be free and travel around the
world!
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
What? I remind
you of someone?
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Everyone wants to travel in
search of freedom at least
once in their life.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
From the looks of
it, you're not free.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Embracing your freedom
is a good thing.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh! ...At last, you've seen all
that this world has to offer!
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Excellent! You are finally
worthy to bear this title.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Truly, you are the only
ones who are worthy!
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Congratulations!
[NatuRangers]!

I never imagined that
this day would come.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
If I pass today, I have the comfort
of knowing that I will carry this
memory with me into the next life.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
You found the [Celestial Hand Mirror]?
Real convenient tool it is, that one.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
So you found the [Liarpecker]?
Oh, I see marks on your forehead!
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
No wait, sorry. Must've
been my imagination.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Well then, let me share with
you an interesting story...
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I spotted a thin beam of light
stretching toward the sky
over near Straylize Temple.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Guess it must finally
be my time to go.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm just kidding, relax.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I heard about a peculiar little
critter down at the village on
the way to Straylize Temple
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
that all the kids hate.
I'm already a big fan.

Just promise me something. No matter

that I was here.
[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, if it isn't <Philia>!
Who are your friends?
[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
Everyone, Bishop <Ayles> is
very grateful for your help.
[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
This is but another test bestowed
by Atamoni. That is what I believe.
[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
May the Goddess bless those of
you who are facing hardship.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
They kept this place locked up
for a while. Somethin' happen?
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
First a voice from the sky,
now a net? Incredible...
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Goddess Atamoni, please
deliver us from this evil...
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
So they found a way to go up to the
sky. This must be another blessing
from the goddess Atamoni.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Good day to you,
Ms. <Philia>!
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
This is Straylize temple.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Ms. <Philia>, what's that
thing floating in the sky?
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
What's that thing
floating in the sky?
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
It's getting colder... Is it because
there's no more sunshine?
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Good luck, Ms. <Philia>!
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Good luck to you!
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
It's been rumored for a long
time that this temple holds
a great treasure.
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
What!? The treasure is
actually a giant lens?
Oh, wow!
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
What a terrible disaster!
I never expected this...
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
The number of monsters is
increasing, we'll be stranded
at the temple for a long time.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, hello, <Lion>. What brings
you to the temple?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm waiting for the Bishop,
but he hasn't arrived yet.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you, <Lion>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I won't forget what you
said. I'll do my best!

Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Titles serve two purposes:
The first is to [affect dialogue 
when talking to NPCs].
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Set a title to have certain NPCs interested
while passing them. When talking with NPCs
multiple times you may get different responses.
Change the title and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to certain NPCs, a [?] will 
appear over the character's head. If this 
happens, set a title that seems to be related
to the dialogue, and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose for titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
