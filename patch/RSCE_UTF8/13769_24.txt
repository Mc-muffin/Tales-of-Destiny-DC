Well, if it isn't
Sir <Lion>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lewein>
[ENDBLOCK]
Has something happened?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm currently on an assignment,
General <Lewein>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lewein>
[ENDBLOCK]
Aha, I see! So
who's this?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
You just had to ask...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
My name is <Stahn> Aileron.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lewein>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is that so? I'm <Lewein>.
Nicholas <Lewein>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lewein>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm one of the Seven
Generals of Seinegald.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Nice to meet you,
General <Lewein>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lewein>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, same here. <Stahn>
Aileron, huh?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lewein>
[ENDBLOCK]
Aileron... Might you be related
to Thomas Aileron...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You know Thomas?
That's my grandpa.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lewein>
[ENDBLOCK]
Really, now! I'm surprised
to see his grandson here.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wait, could it be? The officer
Gramps told me about...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lewein>
[ENDBLOCK]
Indeed, that was me. I owe Thomas
a great deal for saving my life.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
When I was little, he'd tell me
the story of how he saved you
all the time.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lewein>
[ENDBLOCK]
By the way, how is 
your grandmother?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
My grandmother... she's-
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Excuse me, General <Lewein>.
We must hurry on with our
mission.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, right.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lewein>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, of course.
My apologies.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lewein>
[ENDBLOCK]
I need to send a letter to Thomas.
I hope we meet again, sometime.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lewein>
[ENDBLOCK]
Here, take this with you. I'm sure
you'll make good use of it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lewein>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll take a trip to
see Thomas soon.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lewein>
[ENDBLOCK]
All right, hurry up.
Aren't you on an
important mission?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, it's them again!

<Millie>
[ENDBLOCK]
We're not truly heroes,
I'd say that's you guys.
[ENDBLOCK]
<John>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's embarrasin' that
we didn't realize that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Aww, it's nothing. We're
just doing what we must.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Grid>
[ENDBLOCK]
"Doing what we must," huh.
Very well. In that case, so
are we.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Grid>
[ENDBLOCK]
We will devote all of our efforts,
