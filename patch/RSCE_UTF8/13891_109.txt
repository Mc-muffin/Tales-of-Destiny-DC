[ENDBLOCK]
Use your idiot powers to
do something about it.

<IGNORE>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
All right, I'm on it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<ITEM_149> should open it, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
You pried the door open with the pickaxe.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
It won't open. It seems you'll
need a tool to force it open.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
So <Hugo> is actually
<Rutee>'s father...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>'s been away alone
for some time now...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>... please help <Rutee>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
W-Was it somethin'
I said...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
*Sniffle*
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
The R Key we'll need to upgrade
Radisrol should be in the temple
southwest of here.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm counting on you all.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
We must prevent the Aethersphere
from being completed. I'm counting
on you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
The technology here is nothing
short of amazing!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
I definitely made the right call
following you guys here!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
My research indicates that
the Er'thers were routinely
bombarded with some very
powerful armaments.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
However, there appears to be
something here that allowed them
to withstand those attacks.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Stay focused, everyone!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm so proud to be able
to help you out like this!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, right. I forgot
to tell you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Seems there are more
shops here, now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
To find them, leave this room
and enter the rightmost of the
three doors.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
You won't forget that, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
To find them, leave this room
and enter the rightmost of the
three doors.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
I suggest you
go take a look!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah? There's a sword!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's <Clemente>.
[ENDBLOCK]
???
[ENDBLOCK]
Chosen heroes, you've done
well to come this far.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's that? Who're
you callin' heroes?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Eh? Are you really
talking about me?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Old <Clemente> here likes to
play pranks on people.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Pranks...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, well... It's been quite a while, <Dymlos>.
You're still as stubborn as ever.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
You never even wrote, <Clemente>.
You seem to be doing well, though.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, <Atwight>. As sweet as ever.
So you've become a sword, too.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
If you've gone through all the trouble
to come meet me here, then
something must be happening.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
The truth is... the Eye
of Atamoni was stolen.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
So it was true...
I had a bad feeling...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is no time for me to
be enjoying retirement.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
Will you come with us? It would
be reassuring to have you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll be counting on you to service me and
whip these old bones into shape. Hehehe.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I won't let you do
anything weird to 
<Atwight>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Service?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh I get it, like polishing and refining.
Because you're a sword.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, not quite. More like, brimming
with romance, perhaps.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>. It seems like your master
is quite the pure-hearted boy.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
So anyway, how are we gonna
get <Clemente> a master?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
We'll have to think about it later.
No one here possesses the aptitude
to wield a Swordian.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
My master is already here.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
She should arrive shortly... <Philia>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Everyone...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
How did you manage to get here?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I listened to the voice in my
head. It guided me here.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You heard a voice...? 
Was it really <Clemente>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, it was me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
You are the one who called me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
It was your will that wished for me.
Your earnest desire and determination
to become stronger.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
That is why you heard my voice.
I can give you that power.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
All that's left is your final decision.
What say you, <Philia> Felice?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I have to get the Eye of Atamoni
back from the High Priest... No,
from <Greybum>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
No matter what. That is my
responsibility. My duty!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I will fight together with
you. Grant me your power,
<Clemente>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
All right, <Philia>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's thanks to your
encouragement, <Stahn>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>, once again I ask that you
allow me to fight alongside you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's with that? You still
won't acknowledge <Philia>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmph. Just don't be a nuisance.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes! <Lion>, thank you so much.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>, you are still a novice.
That means you are weak.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
However, what you lack in skill, you
make up for in your earnest feelings.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
I have great expectations for you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Please provide us with
your guidance, <Clemente>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Same here. Pleased to make
your acquaintance again!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Good to have you along.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yep yep.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
This ended up being 
a convenient affair.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
Mhm. With this, we can have
some peace of mind.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
Anyway, if I had to get a new
master, I'm sure glad she's a
sprightly young girl.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, everyone. Shall we
return to the ship?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, sounds good.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Since you have 5 people in your party,
you can now use [<turquoise>Support Talent</color>].
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Isn't this the room where
we found <Clemente>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
Indeed, it is.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome, Swordian Team!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
After so many years, I am overjoyed
to be able to gather with everyone
like this once more.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is that <Ritora>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's a holographic image.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
As a new master, there are still many
things you may not understand.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
I will clarify any lingering doubts.
Afterwards, we must decide on
the appropriate countermeasures.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then I'd like to ask you
something right away.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
What, exactly, is
<Hugo> trying to do?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
Giving form to the Aethersphere,
through terraforming.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Terra...forming...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
The chunks of earth broken up
by Belcrant are drawn into the
sky to create a new layer.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
That is the formation of
an Aethersphere around
the Earth.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
Spreading like ivy in the sky is the
 newly formed Aethersphere itself.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
Currently, it's about
25 percent completed.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
I estimate that if Belcrant fires
three more blasts, the sky will
be completely covered.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
If that happens, our Earth will be...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
It will become a world of complete
darkness, and all life will die out.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
No...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
So we must stop it before that
happens. We cannot let our
earthly world be ruined.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What do we need to do?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
We will use the same
blitzkrieg strategy we
used in the last war.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
We will elevate Radisrol
to the surface and land
it directly on Dycroft.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
The surface? Has Radisrol always
been able to do this?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes. After it is in position, you
and the other Swordian Masters
will break into Dycroft.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's the same thing we were trying
to do with the Draconis.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>It's just like what happened
1,000 years ago...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
You think Radisrol can reach altitudes
that the Draconis could not?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's correct.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
All right!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
The goal is to defeat <Hugo> and
take back the Eye of Atamoni.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's not too late. Now, before
the Aethersphere is complete.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's going to be a
race against time.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
Indeed. We must launch
the operation as soon
as possible and settle
this matter at once!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Leave it to us! We'll avenge
<Lion> while we're at it!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, about that...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>...No, it's nothing.
Don't worry about it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...? What a weird guy...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
Before the mission, there is
a place I want you to go.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's not far from Lienea Village.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is that so? I never knew
that was there!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
While you go get the R Key,
I'll continue to analyze the
current situation.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
To ensure we'll be able to handle
anything that may come up.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Please let me help!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is a problem that should be
addressed by all human beings
on Earth.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
I, too, wish to participate in the
mission as a representative of
Seinegald!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
How did this man get in here?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>It looks like he was following
us and boarded the Leviathan.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is amazing! I can't believe such
advanced technology existed in the
olden days!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Please, please let me do this.
I will do whatever it takes!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
//TODO take another look at this.
Wouldn't it be hard for you
to adapt to the technology?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
We don't have much time.
I will put him to work.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Good, then we will go
and get the R Key.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's southwest from Radisrol.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
Everyone, I'm glad to see you've all
made it back here in one piece.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Igtenos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>No time for greetings. Let's get started
on the neutralization device.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Here it is...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
Mm-hmm. Connect the device
to the Swordian to neutralize
the specular barrier.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's how we'll get
close to Dycroft.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now all we have to do is
find a vehicle we can use
to get into Dycroft.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>Right. We're going to go through
Josaia to get to Mikheil.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
To retrieve an Aeth'er Cruiser.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
All right, let's get moving!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you, Swordian Team, for your
hard work in getting the R Key.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
We will now begin preparations
on our end for the surfacing
of Radisrol.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
I want you all to prepare yourselves
for the coming battle and keep your
wits about you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've been assigned as Commander
<Ritora>'s assistant. I look forward
to working with you all!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
How long will it take to
finish the preparations?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
Please wait a little longer.
I'll report back as soon
as I'm done.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
It will be hard to keep calm
if we sit and do nothing.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Everything has been moving
so fast these past few days.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Everything that has happened
so far feels like a dream.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Losing <Lion> was no dream.
I'll definitely avenge him.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>, I'll take care of this.
I'll kill that bastard, <Hugo>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>, no!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why not? What's
wrong with that?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
What is it? Did I say somethin'
I shouldn't have?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
No.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Actually, <Hugo> and <Lion>...
They're father and son...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
That means...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah. Apparently <Hugo>'s
my father, too.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's... I had no idea!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, so what? Don't worry
about it, okay?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I only met him a couple times. It's 
not like he raised me, you know?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
But...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, don't be so gloomy. It's
nothing to worry about.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Just because <Lion> said
it doesn't make it true.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
After what he did, it's possible
he was just lying.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, don't say that! I
feel awful for <Lion>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, really? Well tell me, what would
you do if you were in my shoes!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
*Sob* *Sob*
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll be around. Give me a
shout when you're ready.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Everyone... Sorry about earlier.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you okay?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm fine. <Chelsea>,
please forgive me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's okay. It was my fault. I'm
sorry for being so blunt.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I need to apologize
to everyone, too.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
All I could think about was
getting vengeance for <Lion>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Even though my mouth was saying
other things, in the end, it was all
I could think about.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
But... that's not good enough.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
The first thing we need to think about
now is how we're going to handle this.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I only realized that after talking
it through with <Rutee>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, have you finished
sorting out your thoughts?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Even now, there are still things
I need to consider. But right
now, more than anything...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I think I have to fulfill my
responsibilities as a master.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, I agree with
what <Stahn> said.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't forget about us! This isn't
just the Swordian Masters' fight.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Of course. Everyone here
is an important friend.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
So let's all work together to
end this war at all costs!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Right.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Mm-hmm.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>Swordian Team, we're
ready to launch!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Once we've surfaced, it's
a short walk to Dycroft.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Everyone, are you ready to go?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Absolutely!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>Let's begin the sequence.
Main engine, ignite!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Main engine firing.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
Radisrol, rise!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oww... What just
happened?
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Earth Dwellers, you fools! Why would
you try the same approach twice?
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
I was already prepared for
you to try it again.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
The Arco Draconis is circling above.
We were well prepared for you.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
How do you like it?
You no longer stand a chance!
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<center>You will become a sacrifice to the Guardian
Dragon and be reduced to dust for the Aethersphere!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Aah!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, are you okay?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
We are using most of our remaining
power to deploy a defensive shield.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
We can hold on for a little longer.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
In addition to the Arco Draconis,
there is one other troubling matter.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>, display our
video feed of Dycroft.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
From the looks of it there's something
covering the area around Dycroft.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
A mirror barrier is
deployed on all sides.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's almost impossible to get through
it by hitting it head on.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>Even if we take care of the Guardian
Dragon, we still must deal with the barrier.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is ridiculous. How
can <Hugo> do so much?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>How is it that he knows so much
about Aeropoleis and the Aeth'er Wars?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>He knows too many details, even if the
information wasn't completely covered up.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>It's hard to believe that this
knowledge comes from just
researching historical records.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...I don't care about that!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It doesn't matter what <Hugo> has
learned or what his plans are!
We won't be defeated!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is there anything you
can do, <Ritora>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
We've analyzed all the information
available to us and considered all
possible operational plans.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
We do have a countermeasure. The
odds of success are slim, though...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'd like to hear more details.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
...All right.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
First, we'll focus on making a device
to neutralize the mirror barrier.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
During the time it takes us to
complete it, I would like you to
occupy the other Aeropoleis.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>, current status.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
By the time you reach Mikheil,
we'll have the neutralization
device completed.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
If we can coordinate with each
other, we can approach Dycroft.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's going to be a tough
road, Swordian Team,
but will you do it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Of course! Even if it's impossible,
I'll take my chances against it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Isn't that right, everyone?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, yeah. If we don't have a choice,
we'll just have to do it, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
No need to ask again.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
We will do everything we can to help.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I want to end this war at all costs.
It must be us, by our hands!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's do this!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll do my best too!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well said! All right.
Let's get to work.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
To begin with, sail to your
first destination, Ignasea.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Understood!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wait.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
Please, take this with you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
With this, you can call the
Leviathan at any time.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
Use it near a shore. You can only
enter and exit it from there.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
That is the only requirement
for summoning the Leviathan.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't forget.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character
parameters that can be set. 
The specific method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, press <Square_ani> to 
change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen will be
[Titles]. Press <Triangle_ani> to pick from
all acquired titles.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Titles serve two purposes:
The first is to [affect dialogue 
when talking to NPCs].
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Set a title to have certain NPCs interested
while passing them. When talking with NPCs
multiple times you may get different responses.
Change the title and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to certain NPCs, a [?] will 
appear over the character's head. If this 
happens, set a title that seems to be related
to the dialogue, and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose for titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
