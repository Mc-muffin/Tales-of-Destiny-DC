<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
The color of your complexion is
worrisome... I suppose that's to
be expected after everything.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
How about taking a short rest?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, you're probably right.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
If it isn't <Lion>! You look
like you're doing well.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmph. You seem like
you're living well.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I am. I have you to thank.
After all you let me go.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
My life has become very peaceful
living here with <Dalis>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Speaking of <Dalis>,
where is he now?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
He recently set out to the
northern guard tower.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
He's undergoing medical treatment
at the Frostheim hot springs.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Little by little his condition
is improving.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Good. That's the most
important thing.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
You've come all this way. You
should stay for dinner tonight!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I make one mean Beast
Meat Poelee, you know!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Of course, you are welcome to
stay the night if it gets late.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
There's no need. I won't
be staying long.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why is that?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I have a job to do. I don't
have time for a long visit.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see... That's a shame.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now, I must be off.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't be a stranger.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sure <Dalis> would love
to host you soon.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_005><center>You find a love letter in the
gap between the books.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_005>Dear Mr. <Dalis>,
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
			Your secret admirer
[ENDBLOCK]
<Leader>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's pretend we didn't see this.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_005>Gently, you put the love
letter back in its place.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_005>There are books filled with

[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_005>The snow white grass is dying.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>, take care of yourself.
Make sure you come back.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey guys. Has <Mary>
been helpful?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm feeling much better. Those
hot springs work wonders.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
Entrust Cyril to me. I'll
keep the people safe.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
I think I'll go to the castle and
discuss strategies with <Darzen>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
We can't afford to have the people
of Cyril continue living in turmoil.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
The dragons seem to have been helpful.
I'm sure <Darzen> will be pleased.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, and the rest of you, take care.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
...<Woodrow>, be sure to come back.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
...And <Mary>. I love you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I will never forget what
you have done for me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I hope that we can be
together again soon.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
This house!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is where I live. It isn't
much, but it's mine.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
This potted plant...
It reminds me of
something...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
Snow white grass. It is native to
the Heidelberg Mountains. It has
the most beautiful flowers.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
According to floriography,
it means...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
"Precious Memories."
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
The two of us... wanted to
fill this home with flowers.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You two...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
In this kitchen...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
I came home early because I
wanted to watch you cook.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
He would come home, whispering
sweet nothings into my ear as I
cooked.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
He looked so happy when
he was eating my poelee.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
On cold nights, we would huddle
together in front of the fireplace.
It was like time stood still.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Some nights I had the good fortune of
watching him sleep peacefully through
the night...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
This house is filled with
treasures from the days
I spent with him.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ugh...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's painful... One memory after
another, it's overwhelming...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
It won't stop... My chest...
I feel like it's about to 
burst...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>, what's wrong?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>, I love you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>, get out of here!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Sorry, guys. I lost control
for a moment there...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>, do you remember anything?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah. I remember everything.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Can I ask you something?
Who is that guy?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
He's the owner of this
sword. His name is...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
...<Dalis> Vincent.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wasn't the guy we met earlier
named Captain <Dalis>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
He is my husband.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Husband!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Husband!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Husband!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Her husband, huh?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis> was an idealistic man who
wanted to change this country.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Many people longed for the future
of this country as he described it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
A large number of people gathered
under him, and soon they became
the "Cyril Volunteer Army."
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
My purpose in life was
to be there for him and
support him.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
And...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
How many years have passed
since then...? When my city was
besieged by the royal army...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
The Royal Army?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
You mean the civil
war two years ago.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis> was the leader of the
volunteer army and led them
in a heroic battle.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Shoulder to shoulder,
we fought as one.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
But in the end, we were outnumbered.
The volunteer army was defeated, and
my comrades were scattered.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
How did that happen?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't know the exact
reason. The only thing
I can say for sure is...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
It was the work of
<Woodrow>'s father,
<King> Isaac.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
No way.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now back to the story.
What happened next?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I fled with <Dalis> to the great river
up north, but we were hunted down
by the royal army.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
In a desperate gamble,
<Dalis> tried to save me...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
...by pushing me off a cliff.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
And this shocked you so much
that you lost your memory?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I suppose that is possible...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
How could <Dalis> not
recognize <Mary>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't think that's what
happened. He knew, but
pretended not to know.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why would he do that...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
It seems that this man, <Dalis>, is
deeply involved in this rebellion.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Does this mean that <Dalis>
is assisting <Greybum>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't understand... any of it...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Was it a mistake...
coming back here?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is no time to dwell on it.
In a case like this, there's only
one thing to do.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ask him directly for an answer.
It's the fastest way.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I agree. As I recall, he said he
was going back to Heidelberg.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
His destination is the same as ours.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's go after him, <Mary>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you, both of you... With everyone
by my side, I may have the courage to
see this through.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I have heard the name
<Dalis> Vincent before.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
He's the one that advocated for Cyril's
independence and was the cause of the
uprising two years ago.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
If he's so dangerous, then why
  is he doing as he pleases?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I only knew of his imprisonment.
There's more to this than meets
the eye.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's go to Heidelberg. Thinking about
it here isn't going to do any good.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
What a situation this has grown into...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, I know.
