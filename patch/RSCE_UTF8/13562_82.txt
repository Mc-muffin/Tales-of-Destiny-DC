<TAG_005><center>Slowly pulsing beneath the floor
are the remnants of what
was once a living thing.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
We managed to escape...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Lord <Woodrow>, something is
wrong with the ocean! Is... is
something coming out of it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
It can't be...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
What... the hell is that thing?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
Dycroft...! It's actually back...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
What in Atamoni's
name is a Dycroft?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>It is an Aeropolis that was
once used in the Aeth'er Wars.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Aeth'er Wars...? Aeropolis...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>I'm picking up energy readings
all over the world. Perhaps it's
the work of other Aeropoleis.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>I didn't expect for them all to be
revived simultaneously. He must
have accounted for everything.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
So this was <Hugo>'s goal...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>He must be using the Eye 
of Atamoni as a power source.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
So that's what <Hugo> meant...
That's the true purpose of
the Eye of Atamoni!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>Now we know why <Greybum>
had been traveling the world.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>He was preparing to use the Eye of
Atamoni to revive the Aeropoleis!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
In hindsight, it all makes sense.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's that...? The bottom of the
Aeropoleis, they're... glowing.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is bad, it's Belcrant!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
This cannot be... An abyss has
been carved into the Earth...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, dear goddess...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>, what are
you planning?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't be ridiculous...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You can't be serious!
The Aeth'er Wars!
The Aeropoleis!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Because of that nonsense...
<Lion> is...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, what are you doing!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What do you think!? We're
going to avenge <Lion>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>...! Because of
people like you...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I won't allow it! I'll
never forgive you!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Calm down, <Stahn>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
GRAAAAAAAAH!

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character
parameters that can be set. 
The specific method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, press <Square_ani> to 
change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen will be
[Titles]. Press <Triangle_ani> to pick from
all acquired titles.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Titles serve two purposes:
The first is to [affect dialogue 
when talking to NPCs].
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Set a title to have certain NPCs interested
while passing them. When talking with NPCs
multiple times you may get different responses.
Change the title and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to certain NPCs, a [?] will 
appear over the character's head. If this 
happens, set a title that seems to be related
to the dialogue, and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose for titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
