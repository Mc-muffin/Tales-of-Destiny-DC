<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
Your Highness, would
you like to rest?
Yes
No

[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
Will everyone be resting?
Yes
No

[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
Some of <Greybum>'s monsters
can impair your abilities.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't let your guard down.
[ENDBLOCK]
Weapon Shop
[ENDBLOCK]
I used to sell weapons in the city. If
you see anything you'd like, just let
me know. With your gald.
[ENDBLOCK]
Item Shop
[ENDBLOCK]
I've brought some things from the
store. Feel free to use them if you
need them. For a price, of course.
[ENDBLOCK]
Uniques Shop
[ENDBLOCK]
Why at a time
like this...?
[ENDBLOCK]
Uniques Shop
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome. What 
can I get you?
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Mr. <Darzen> brought me here.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
He and I managed
to escape together.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
The rest of my family
fled separately though.
I hope they're okay...
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
The people here are the ones
who rebelled against <Greybum>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Prince <Woodrow>, please! Bring
peace back to Heidelberg!
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Everyone, please! Bring
peace back to Heidelberg!
[ENDBLOCK]
Grocer
[ENDBLOCK]
A king may rule over people,
but hunger rules over him.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
Because of <Greybum>, the people
in the castle are terrified.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
How does he control
so many monsters?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
The Eye of Atamoni, maybe...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
Regardless, it's those who
joined the rebellion that
we should truly pity.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum> won them over with
promises of revolution, and
they fell for it completely.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now, as our homes burn,
we lay at his mercy!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Impossible... <Dalis>
would never allow
that to happen!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why do you yet stand
by that man?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Forget it.
Keep talking.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
His Majesty made the
right choice, after all...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's only natural that those who
threaten the Royal Family would
be subjugated.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
We were threatened?
What do you mean?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
Were you not aware, 
Your Highness?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
Two years ago, a group of Cyrilians
arrived at the castle. They demanded
immediate independence.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
They threatened that if the king
refused, then they would revolt.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
It can't be...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, I was not
aware of this...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
 So the Royal Army was
sent to subjugate Cyril...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
They threatened an uprising.
It's only natural that he'd do
that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
No... This can't be
right. <Dalis> would
never do that!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Where in the castle
is <Greybum> now?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
He is often seen in the tower.
He's likely still there now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
And <Dalis>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
Of course he'll be around. 
He's practically <Greybum>'s
second in command, after
all.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Guess there's only one
place to go, huh?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't understand... What
was <Dalis> thinking!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Did I truly not
know him at all?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>, keep your chin up. You've
come this far, you've got to find
out the truth.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't worry. I'm
here for you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Y-Yeah...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
We need to get going.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, you're right.
Let's settle this!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
If <Dalis> really is willingly
helping <Greybum>, then...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
When the time comes...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>, what was my
late father like from 
your point of view?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
He was an incredible ruler,
truly deserving of the title
"Wise King."
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
He always had Phandaria's best interests
at heart. Though he had to make difficult
choices, he was always decisive.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
He never wavered in his beliefs,
nor did he ever question himself.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
Your Highness, the hopes of
the people now rest on you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
Once you have dealt with <Greybum>,
you will need to take the throne as
soon as possible.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I never knew... He committed
such an atrocity...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Am I truly worthy of
succeeding my father?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Lord <Woodrow>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, forgive me. I'll
be right behind you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Family...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is something wrong?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What are you doing over there?
Come on, get your butt in gear!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I know, I'm coming!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Once this mission is over,
I'll likely never see her again...

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character
parameters that can be set. 
The specific method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, press <Square_ani> to 
change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen will be
[Titles]. Press <Triangle_ani> to pick from
all acquired titles.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Titles serve two purposes:
The first is to [affect dialogue 
when talking to NPCs].
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Set a title to have certain NPCs interested
while passing them. When talking with NPCs
multiple times you may get different responses.
Change the title and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to certain NPCs, a [?] will 
appear over the character's head. If this 
happens, set a title that seems to be related
to the dialogue, and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose for titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
[ENDBLOCK]
