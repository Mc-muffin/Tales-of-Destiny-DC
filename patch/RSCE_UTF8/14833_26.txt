Uncle Bob
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, is that you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Uncle Bob!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Uncle Bob...? I've heard
that name before.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's Aunt Maggie's husband, from
Lienea. She said he was missing...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, yeah. <Stahn>, didn't you say that he
might be living on the Aethersphere...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
And here he is!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
See, I knew my hunch was right.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
But how did you survive?
[ENDBLOCK]
Uncle Bob
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, if I had to guess, I'd say
good luck and these clothes.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What is more important is that Aunt
Maggie is really worried about you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah. We should get you
back to her right away.
[ENDBLOCK]
Uncle Bob
[ENDBLOCK]
So you... don't have anything 
to say about my outfit...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Not really, I've seen that
kind of nonsense before.
[ENDBLOCK]
Uncle Bob
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, I see...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
We'll take you home. Let's
go back to Lienea village.
[ENDBLOCK]
Uncle Bob
[ENDBLOCK]
That'd be great. I couldn't figure
out a way to get back on my own.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>, wait here. I'll take
him back with the Draconis.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, I got it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
That was fast. Was Aunt
Maggie happy?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yup, she was very happy. And
I got a thank-you as well.
[ENDBLOCK]
Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome to Katz Village.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wow. These are pretty
strange, aren't they?
[ENDBLOCK]
Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Our people were launched into the
sky durrring the bombardment of
the world below.
[ENDBLOCK]
Rabbitz
[ENDBLOCK]
Since that day, we have
all lived here in peace.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
But we're here to destroy
the Aethersphere...
[ENDBLOCK]
Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
We'll be purrfectly fine.

[ENDBLOCK]
Rabbitz
[ENDBLOCK]
We've been building a rocket using
spare parts we've scrounged up.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
A rocket...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, what's a rocket?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't ask me. I have no
idea about that stuff.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
How adorable!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
You must want to be held.
[ENDBLOCK]
Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
H-Hey... This lady's looking
at me kinda scary-like...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Doesn't that sound niiice~?
[ENDBLOCK]
Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
No, no, no! I'm not a baby!
I'm a purrfect adult!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're an adult?
[ENDBLOCK]
Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right, mrrow! If you
held me like a baby...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'd fall over~!
[ENDBLOCK]
Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
I have the purrfect idea! Instead of
holding me, I'll give you something
that makes you feel just as nice.
[ENDBLOCK]
Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Nyow, come here.
[ENDBLOCK]
Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Now anyone can feel like a
Katz with this Katznip suit!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
What the heck...?
This is really rigid!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Seriously, <Mary>. It's impossible
to fight wearing that thing.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then I'll just wear it at home.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, I'm sure <Dalis> would love
seeing you in that outfit...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Don't say that, <Philia>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I get it...

From the looks of it,
you're not free, Nyan!
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
However, it is only in the midst
of adversity that we can find
the value of freedom, Nyan!
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
I think it's important to take a
journey in search of freedom.

However, it is only in the midst
of adversity that we can find
the value of freedom.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I think it's important to take a
journey in search of freedom.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
After finding myself,
I ended up coming
back here...
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't get me wrong, it's fun to
be free and travel around the
world!
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, it looks like you're
enjoying your freedom.

[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man

Everyone wants to travel in

[ENDBLOCK]

I never imagined that

[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
If I pass today, I have the comfort
of knowing that I will carry this
memory with me into the next life.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Mew found the [Glowmoss]?
That soft green glow...
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
It invokes such a sense
of mewitching beauty.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Purrhaps I'm losing it
in my advanced age.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
I see mew've found the [Will-o'-the-Wisp].
I understand the theory behind them.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
And that's exactly why I can't stop
pawndering about the souls of the
dead.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Mew found the [Black Worm]?
That thing was as quick as
it was abnormal-looking.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Finding it would be impawssible
for someowne with my tired old
eyes.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Pah, it wasn't meowch
of a looker anyway.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
So mew've found the [Tablet of Laws].
The cat burglars who were looking to
pawn it off during all that chaos with
<Greybum>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
meowst've gotten hit during
Belcrant's bombardment.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
That's what I figure, anyway. Now
they're suffuring the catsequences.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Mew found the [Tear Flower]?
It's as deadly as it is beautiful...
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Just like meowr's truly!
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Mew found the
[Big Horned Beetle].
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
It's a purrfect example of
how looks can be deceiving.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Mew found the [Skull Crag]?
Not only does it look creepy, it also
lets out a blood-currdling scream!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
S-Speaking fur everyone,
that is. I'm no scaredy-cat.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Mew found the [Quick Cricket]!
They really do live a quick life.
Must be purretty rough for them.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Mew found the [Burning Mallet]?
Don't furget about its heat blasts.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Stay three meters away
or you'll get burrnt.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
So, Mew found the
[Mountaineer's Flower]?
It purrfurs high places,
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
so consider yourself the cat's meow
if you spot one anywhere else.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Mew found the
[Moist Mouse]?
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Did you know this is how the
phrase "like a drowned rat"
got popular?
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
...Cat believe
you fell for that.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Mew found the [Leech Frog].
They slurp up people's blood...
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
That's pawsitively outrageous!
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Mew found the [Rashweed]?
They're actually my favorite
food.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Just kitten! If you ate one
of those your tummy would
break.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
I see mew found the [Happiness Bird].
I got my claws on one too a long time
ago.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
I was happy, but
fur some reason
it felt empty.
So I let it go.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
That's when I realized I wasn't the kind
of Katz that could be sathissfied with
happiness given by
someone else.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Well then, let me share with
you an interesting story...
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
There's a plant growing near Rodeon
that's meowt of this world.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm not spurrling the surprise. meow'll
have to see it for yourself.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
There's a spawt near Deimos where
grudges left by earthly creatures
float about in the air.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Best not speak of
them too catsually...
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Mew wouldn't want them
getting any angrier...
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
I spawtted an incredibly swift
creature near Josaia.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
It's almost impurrceptibly fast.
Good luck trying to catch it.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
I spied a treasure clawst by
the Phandarian royal family
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
in the hairea near Ignasea.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Meow why would it be over there...?
The world may never know, purrhaps.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
A beautiful flower that's used to
make dangerouse meowdicines
grows near Josaia.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Beauty and danger all
in one package... Just
like meowr's truly!
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
There's a bug on the Aethersphere.
It's purrobably somewhere near
the city with a research facility.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
...Don't hiss at
me if I'm wrong.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
There's a spawt near Dycroft where you
can hear a blood-currdling scream.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Sorry, but I couldn't
find the purrpetrator.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Mew think I got scared
and ran off with my tail
between my legs?
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
I searched the whole area
but came up empty-clawed!
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
There's an insect near
Deimos that really makes
you apurreciate the
furragility of life.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Mew should find it too so you
can share that appurreciation.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
I felt a burrning heat near
the city that controlled
the Arco Draconis.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
It was too hot to stick around so
I don't know what clawsed it.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
I spawted a flower that only grows in
high places near the city that used to
be a meowlitary stronghold.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Mew don't know which
one that was? It was...
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
T-The one that used to be
a meowlitary stronghold!
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Mew don't even know which one
that is? ...That is unfurrtunate.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
There's a creature that's never
been seen before in the area
furrounding Rodeon.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
How is it even pawssible for
animals to evolve this quickly!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Watch out if you're going to travel
clawse to Dycroft, there's a very
dangerous animal lurking around.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
If meow're not careful you
might end up getting really
hurt!
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Dangerous plants have spurrung up in
the area near one of the cities after
breaking out of an expurrimentation
plant.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Mew should be careful if
you're walking around.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Mew aren't sure which
city that was?
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
It was the one with the...
expurrimentation plant...
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Cat's got my tongue...
I cat remember either.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Meow'll find a creature near
the city with the research lab
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
that can paward people with
their deepest desires. And
its exact location is...
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
...Only fur me to know~
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]

even if some time has passed.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Meow my gosh ...At last, at last,
you've seen  all that this world
has to offur!
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Excellent! Meow're worthy
to bear this name!
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
No, meow're the only ones!
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Congrcatulations!
[NatuRangers]!
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
I never imeowgined that

[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Meow I can rest in peace
having expurrienced such
wonderful nine lives.
[ENDBLOCK]
Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
There is nothing to do
and this cat is borrred.
[ENDBLOCK]
Rabbitz
[ENDBLOCK]
Ussa, Ussa! The best way to tease
these Katz is with a simple 'Ussa!'
[ENDBLOCK]
Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
I purrrfur only the tip.

[ENDBLOCK]
Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't be so purrrverted,
I'm talking about money.

[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
This cutie is Noko.
Isn't he purrrfect?
[ENDBLOCK]
Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, it's so purrrescious.
[ENDBLOCK]
Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Making rockcats is so tiring. I just
want to lay in the sun and take a
cat nap.
[ENDBLOCK]
Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
