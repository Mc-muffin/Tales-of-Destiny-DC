...but that's not really
relevant to you right
now.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
You need to work on
your skills more.
[ENDBLOCK]
Monster Researcher
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh? You don't have a
Battle Records book?
[ENDBLOCK]
Monster Researcher
[ENDBLOCK]
You look strong enough.
Take this.
[ENDBLOCK]
Monster Researcher
[ENDBLOCK]
It demonstrates the effective monster
killing technique, "Definite Strike."
[ENDBLOCK]
Monster Researcher
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm studying the [Definite Strike]
section of the Battle Records book.
[ENDBLOCK]
Monster Researcher
[ENDBLOCK]
If you don't mind, could you
assist me in my research?
[ENDBLOCK]
Monster Researcher
[ENDBLOCK]
If you successfully pull off a
[Definite Strike], you'll see a
★ next to the monster's name
in the book.
[ENDBLOCK]
Monster Researcher
[ENDBLOCK]
If you get all of them, I'll
give you something nice.

Did you know that monsters
have lens in their bodies?
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Theoretically, by making a large

be possible to control monsters.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character
parameters that can be set. 
The specific method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, press <Square_ani> to 
change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen will be
[Titles]. Press <Triangle_ani> to pick from
all acquired titles.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Titles serve two purposes:
The first is to [affect dialogue 
when talking to NPCs].
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Set a title to have certain NPCs interested
while passing them. When talking with NPCs
multiple times you may get different responses.
Change the title and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to certain NPCs, a [?] will 
appear over the character's head. If this 
happens, set a title that seems to be related
to the dialogue, and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose for titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
