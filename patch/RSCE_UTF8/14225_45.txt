Please! You know
I love cats!

Uhm... No, I didn't

Aw, come on, <Stahn>.

Well, okay. If you really want

We'll be helping someone,

[ENDBLOCK]

Yes, what can I do for you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, I'm looking for a
certain something...
[ENDBLOCK]
Innkeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
I see! Rumor has it that what
you're looking for is deep in
the Tilso Forest to the north.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Really!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you so much!
Well, off I go, then!
[ENDBLOCK]
Innkeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
Excuse me, are you really
going there alone?
[ENDBLOCK]
Innkeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
What about your friends?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Please keep this a secret
from everyone.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is something
I have to do alone.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
All righty, I reckon I'm off
to Tilso Forest, then!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hehe! Big bro'll
be so surprised!
[ENDBLOCK]
Innkeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
What you're looking for
should be in Tilso Forest.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
I can't believe you're
going alone, though...
Please be careful!

Ah... Big bro...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>! Where have you
been all by yourself!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You left without a word!
We were so worried!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Sorry... I just wanted
to go for a walk.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Come on, let's go
back to the others.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, big bro?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm giving this to you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is this...
an herb?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yep!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
But... why?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's just something I came
across on my walk.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well here, why don't
you use it, <Lilith>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ugh, seriously!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're fighting and risking your
life, trying to save the world!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
So no, YOU use it!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
All right, fine!
I'll take it, then.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't just take it! Make
sure you use it!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
If you don't, then even
when you're awake, I'll...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
W-wait, <Lilith>! I'll use it!
I promise! I swear!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then it's settled.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thanks again, <Lilith>.
Seriously.

Oh, you're...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...
[ENDBLOCK]
Select
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>What is it?
(...Just ignore her...)
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
You're a girl, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
What was that!? Say that
again, see what happens...
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Eeek! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, are you from Seinegald?
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
If so, do you know a knight
by the name of <Lion>?
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
//please don't change the naming convention here.
//using he and him ruins the punchline, which is
//that the chick thinks Leon is a girl. it's a bit opaque
//until the end in the jp, so they/ them is unfortunately
//the only way to maintain the integrity of the joke.

I've only seen their face
from a distance, once.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
I utterly adore them.
They're so dreamy!
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
They have such a petite body, yet they
are so graceful on the battlefield with
all those strong men in tow.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
So I've come up with the
perfect title for <Lion>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
"The Rose of Seinegald."
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
I may be a girl, but if
it was <Lion>, then...
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>, dear, is that you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're...
[ENDBLOCK]
Select
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>It's been a while.
Who are you...?
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
It has, <Mary>. I heard
you lost your memory.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yep. Made lots of room in
my head, that's for sure.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Hahaha. You're
so funny, <Mary>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
I wanted to see <Dalis>' handsome
face again, so I'll be visiting Cyril
sometime soon!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sure he's looking
forward to it!
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
You're such a kidder, <Mary>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
How are things going
with you and <Dalis>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, it's you!
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Hah! I knew you recognized
me! "Who are you?," indeed!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis> told me about you.
He said you looked after
him when he was just a
little brat.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, you have quite
the memory...
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
You're the perfect wife for a
hard-headed dolt like <Dalis>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Keep <Dalis> in line. I want to hold
his child in my arms soon!
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Uhm, excuse me...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm?
[ENDBLOCK]
Select
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Yes, young miss?
Sorry, no autographs on my down time.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Your bare chest is making
me uncomfortable.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Nonsense! All women
dig my shirtless style!
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Not this one...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Gahaha! You can't be serious!
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
I... what?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
You can get my
autograph later!
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
That's not what I...
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, why aren't you
wearing a shirt?
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sure your companions are
wondering the same thing.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Gahaha! Ain't it obvious! I wouldn't
want to deprive anyone a chance to
see these muscles!
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
What a weirdo...<x00>
