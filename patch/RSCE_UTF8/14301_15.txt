[ENDBLOCK]
Um, excuse me, sir...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you mean me?
[ENDBLOCK]
Select
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>I'm sorry, I'm in a hurry.
How can I be of assistance?
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Please, just listen to
what I have to say?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Very well.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Frankly speaking, I want to
meet the King of Phandaria.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
The way you speak tells me
that you are different from
the others.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Perhaps a man who can gain
access to the castle?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
What business do you
have with the king?
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
That is none of your concern.
All that matters is that you
help me meet with the king.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
If you will not be honest with me,
then I cannot help you. I'm sorry.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll be quick! Are you... able
to meet with the king?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Yes, I am.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Really? In that case, can you
get me an audience with him?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why do you need
to see him?
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Since you were kind enough
to hear me out, I'll tell you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
The truth is... my house was
burned down during the riot.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
My entire family, except for my
very young brother and sister,
were killed.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
I begged the soldiers in the area
to help. They said they want to,
but I needed to wait my turn.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
But... if I have to wait any longer...
My brother and sister...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Say no more. I will personally
report your circumstances to
His Majesty at once.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
R-Really!? Thank you!
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
By the way, what's your name?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
My name is... I am simply someone
who loves this country with all his
heart.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you so much!

and the winds are still.
[ENDBLOCK]

That is to say, it's a real
one-in-a-million sight.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Well then, let me share with
you an interesting story...
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
A merchant from Seinegald
told me that shortly
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
after passing over the border, they
spotted a plant that seemed to be
playing tricks on people.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
...At least I think they did.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
The vegetation may have suffered
during the disturbance in the city
two years prior,
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
but there's still something
precious there that nobody
could ever take away.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
It's quite poetic.
