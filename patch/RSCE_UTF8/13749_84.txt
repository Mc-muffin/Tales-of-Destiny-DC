[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, we meet again!
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh? <Lion>'s not
with you today?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You guys again!?
Give me a break!
[ENDBLOCK]
Rude Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, wherever he is, he's probably
clinging to his old man <Hugo>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah. Rumor has it that they're
being hunted by the military.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Shut up!
[ENDBLOCK]
Rude Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
You say something? I couldn't
quite hear you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Rude Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Hehe, this is awesome. This time,
I'll make you my girl for sure!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Both of you,
just shut up.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
What'd you say, bitch!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Didn't hear me?
I'll say it again.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Shut your goddamn
freakin' mouths!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>!
[ENDBLOCK]
Rude Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
...
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Cussing like that ain't
very ladylike, y'know?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hurry up and draw your blades!
I'll wait as long as you want.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
But after that... I ain't
holding back!
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Obstinate little bitch...!
[ENDBLOCK]
Rude Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Stop it.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
You can't be serious. You
want me to back down!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Rude Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes. Leave.
[ENDBLOCK]
Rude Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
I apologize for being rude...
[ENDBLOCK]
Manager
[ENDBLOCK]
Come to think of it, I haven't seen
those hooligans wooing you lately.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I guess they've learned their
lesson, haven't they?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Especially after having a girl
point a sword at them.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What does it matter!?
It's all in the past.
[ENDBLOCK]
Manager
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Long time, no see.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, you know <Rutee>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What the hell do you want?
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you for before.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What? Where have
we met before?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What are you talking about, <Stahn>?
He's that rude soldier from before.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Really? He looks
totally different.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
He looks entirely different when
he isn't wearing his armor.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I quit my job as a soldier
and am currently helping
my family back home.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, is that so?
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
So, um... well...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What? Spit it out already.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
P-Please... Come
home with me!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You can't be serious...!
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I want you to meet
my parents.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Uh, that's impossible.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Instant rejection!
[ENDBLOCK]
Manager
[ENDBLOCK]
Instant rejection!
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I see...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I still have a lot
of work to do.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Right, <Stahn>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh? Oh...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
While I can't go back with
you to your hometown...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Your offer was
really sweet.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Because of that...
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I just want to
say thank you.

Ask yourself the question honestly.

I'll continue to run the

[ENDBLOCK]
Manager
[ENDBLOCK]
Recently, the number of customers
has been increasing. I guess they
can't help but drink.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Don't worry. We have milk

[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
When you return safely, I'll
treat you to a reserve wine.

[ENDBLOCK]
Those rude soldiers haven't been in.
I guess the rude awakening worked.
[ENDBLOCK]
Clerk
[ENDBLOCK]
This is a business practice known
as "cosplay." It's quite popular in
the city.
[ENDBLOCK]
Clerk
[ENDBLOCK]
However, I feel like we should be
allowed to wear normal uniforms
while preparing to open.
[ENDBLOCK]
Clerk
[ENDBLOCK]
I never thought I would
look like this at work...
[ENDBLOCK]
Clerk
[ENDBLOCK]
I suppose it can't be helped.
Customers always get what
they want.
[ENDBLOCK]
Clerk
[ENDBLOCK]
Is it true that you can
buy lens at the castle?
[ENDBLOCK]
Clerk
[ENDBLOCK]
If you want to see my new
outfit, you'd better come
back in one piece!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
A way to the top, huh?
I wonder how we can
do that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>, do you have any ideas?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
No.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's the matter, <Dymlos>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You've been acting strange
since we got back to Earth.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You barely speak anymore.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's not true.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then help me think. We can figure
this out if we work together.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
About that, <Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
You guys have done some amazing
 things. However, it's impossible.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is that supposed to be a joke?
This isn't like you, <Dymlos>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>This is not a joke. This is the
calm judgment of a soldier.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
As <Woodrow> said, we have
no means to get up there.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You can't be serious...
There has to be a way.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Even if we find a way,
 we will die up there.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>We are no match for <Miktran>.
You've already seen what he can do.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Maybe next time we can win.
We don't know unless we try!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
We do! We are no match for him.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
And the reason is clear!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
What do you mean?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Igtenos>
[ENDBLOCK]
...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you guys hiding
something from us?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
The thing is...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
..."False Swordian Masters."
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
These are the words that
<Miktran> threw at us.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've been trying to figure out
what it means. Perhaps the
answer lies inside us...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
What do you think, Swordians?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>There are certain conditions that
are necessary for a Swordian to
reach its maximum power.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
You mean having all six of them?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>No. While important, it's
not a requirement.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Igtenos>
[ENDBLOCK]
The essence of the Swordian and
their Master must be in resonance.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>"It is only by becoming fully attuned to
the wielder's spirit that the Swordian
can achieve its true potential."
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's our true nature.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>That's one of the reasons why
<Miktran> was so strong.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>The core crystal of <Belserius> has
been overwritten by <Miktran>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
No way...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
So if our "spirits" continue to be at
odds, we cannot achieve what the
original Masters could...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
So that is why <Miktran> denounced
us as imitations...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Igtenos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Most likely...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>, you knew that this entire
time and didn't say anything?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
...That is correct.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You must be joking...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why would you do that!? Why 
didn't you tell us until now!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
I didn't mean to deceive you.
I have done everything I can.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>Your growth has been remarkable.
That much I cannot deny.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>But when compared to <Miktran>,
there is no way you can succeed!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
So, you're saying I should give up?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I won't stand for that!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You dragged me this far.
How can you be so cruel?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
We always figure things
out. We can handle it!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
The impossible is impossible!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>What exactly do you think you can do?
You idiot, you won't succeed!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sorry. I was out of line.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Was saying such a thing to
<Stahn> really a good idea?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't want him rushing through life
because of a sense of urgency.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's okay to savor the moment when
near the object of our passion.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
That makes sense.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
In reality, I just wanted to
see what would happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
I mean, what can I say?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
There was another factor at play. He
would have failed if I didn't interfere.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Another factor?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's the matter, sweetheart?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
One milk! In an extra large mug!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>, have a bad day?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Drowning her cares with milk
should be fine... right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, we all have times we deal with
our pain with drink, even if it's milk.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Yes.
Yo! Me too!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, come on. You don't want milk.
