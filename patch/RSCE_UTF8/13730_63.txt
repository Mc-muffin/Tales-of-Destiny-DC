Hey you! Yeah, you.
Be my girl.

What's with this kid?
The hell you going to

[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, don't start a fight.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
But, <Lion>.
These guys...

[ENDBLOCK]
N-No way... <Lion>?
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
What's the matter with you?
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Dumbass! This is <Lion> Magnus,
the Hedge Knight!!
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
This guy's...
That's <Lion>!?
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Screw this, I'm outta here!
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
You better run, you pigs!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You bailed us out.
Thanks, <Lion>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmph!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hold up. What kind of reputation do
you have to cause that reaction?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
How would I know!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Rude Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, we meet again!
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh? <Lion>'s not
with you today?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You guys again!?
Give me a break!
[ENDBLOCK]
Rude Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, wherever he is, he's probably
clinging to his old man <Hugo>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah. Rumor has it that they're
being hunted by the military.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Shut up!
[ENDBLOCK]
Rude Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
You say something? I couldn't
quite hear you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Rude Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Hehe, this is awesome. This time,
I'll make you my girl for sure!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Both of you,
just shut up.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
What'd you say, bitch!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Didn't hear me?
I'll say it again.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Shut your goddamn
freakin' mouths!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>!
[ENDBLOCK]
Rude Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
...
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Cussing like that ain't
very ladylike, y'know?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hurry up and draw your blades!
I'll wait as long as you want.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
But after that... I ain't
holding back!
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Obstinate little bitch...!
[ENDBLOCK]
Rude Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Stop it.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
You can't be serious. You
want me to back down!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Rude Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes. Leave.
[ENDBLOCK]
Rude Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
I apologize for being rude...

Come to think of it, I haven't seen

I guess they've learned their

[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Especially after having a girl
point a sword at them.

What does it matter!?
It's all in the past.

What the hell do you want?
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you for before.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What? Where have
we met before?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What are you talking about, <Stahn>?
He's that rude soldier from before.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Really? He looks
totally different.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
He looks entirely different when
he isn't wearing his armor.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I quit my job as a soldier
and am currently helping
my family back home.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, is that so?

Man
[ENDBLOCK]
So, um... well...
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
What? Spit it out already.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
P-Please... Come
home with me!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You can't be serious...!
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I want you to meet
my parents.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Uh, that's impossible.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Instant rejection!
[ENDBLOCK]
Manager
[ENDBLOCK]
Instant rejection!
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I see...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I still have a lot
of work to do.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Right, <Stahn>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh? Oh...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
While I can't go back with
you to your hometown...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Your offer was
really sweet.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Because of that...
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I just want to
say thank you.
