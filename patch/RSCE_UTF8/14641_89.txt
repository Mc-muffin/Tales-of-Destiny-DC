<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why? To restore the glory of the
Aeth'er Empire to this world, of
course!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thus the Aeth'er war begins anew!
...And with it, a new chapter!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Did we finally find
the Eye of Atamoni!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>No, that's just a 3D projection.
It's probably a representation
of the Eye's current status.
[ENDBLOCK]
???
[ENDBLOCK]
That is far enough.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
There he is...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
To think you would march into Belcrant.
Your struggle, despite being in vain, is
quite admirable.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>, your plan ends here.
Your free reign is over.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
The allies you relied on are gone.
You are all that remains.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you ready?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You don't stand a chance.
This is where we put an
end to your war!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hehehe...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ha-ha-ha! You cannot
achieve victory!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's so funny?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
You are all so simple-minded.
Didn't you hear from <Lion>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
From <Lion>...? What...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
The amount of power I possess...
You didn't even ask him about it,
did you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll never forget how that young
swordsman cowered on the floor
and begged for my forgiveness!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't insult <Lion>! He would
never do such a thing!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Resistance is futile. Nevertheless...
I'll allow you all to entertain me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion> didn't even try to put up a fight.
But now, I finally get to use this.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Swordians... You should
recognize this blade!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Igtenos>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, no way...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
...<Belserius>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Who's <Belserius>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>Lost during the last Aeth'er War...
It's the Sixth Swordian...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
How did you get your hands on him!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Belserius> was secretly transported
to the surface by the remnants of
the Aetherian Army.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Safeguarded in Calvalese,
now in my possession!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>But I thought <Belserius>
was damaged in battle.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Once we meet in battle, it will
become clear if it is damaged.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center><Belserius>, is that really you?
If you can hear me, answer me!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Belserius>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you ready, you insects?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
You shall now fall to this grand blade!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Guh...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now... it's over...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>I didn't think we could go
toe-to-toe with <Belserius>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, isn't something strange going
on with the Eye of Atamoni?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah. The glow is growing stronger!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Everyone, look! <Belserius>
is glowing as well!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>What in the world is
happening to <Belserius>!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You still have some
fight left!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hehehe... Did you really
think that was enough
to defeat me?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
No matter how much you pests
fight back, you cannot compete
with me, the superior being!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
As long as I have <Belserius>,
I am invincible!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You... Who are you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I noticed something... strange earlier.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you really <Hugo>? ...You're
really someone else, aren't you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, what are you talking about?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I demand an answer!
[ENDBLOCK]
???
[ENDBLOCK]
My, my. For such a lowly creature,
you have pretty good instincts.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
That... That voice!
[ENDBLOCK]
???
[ENDBLOCK]
For your keen senses, I shall
allow you to bear witness to
my true form.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Aaaaah!

[ENDBLOCK]
It can't be!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Who's that?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! I descend! I, King
of the Aetherians, descend upon this
world once more!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
How can... How can this be!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
How can... <Miktran>...
just appear like this?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
The technology of us Aetherians
has always been superior to that
of you Er'thers.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
If you have a host body and the Eye
of Atamoni, one can cheat death and
be resurrected!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Igtenos>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is also the power of the Eye!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
To disregard the human
body in such a way...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Everything that's happened...
It was all your doing, wasn't it!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
And what if it was?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I knew it!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
Swordians!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
You thought you were the ones
who were supposed to have won
the war, didn't you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
How naive! During the war, I projected
my own consciousness into <Belserius>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
Unbeknownst to everyone, I have
been in possession of <Belserius>
the entire time!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
What the...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
Pretending to be broken was humiliating,
but thanks to "him", I accumulated some
very... useful information.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
The former personality of <Belserius>
was quite the brainiac, wasn't he?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
You mean Karell...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
So his name was Karell...? No matter.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Igtenos>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's how you were able to
develop the mirror barrier...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
And when <Hugo> unearthed me, I took
over his consciousness as well.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
All this time, <Hugo> was
my little puppet.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo> was nothing more than a
lowly Er'ther. I was the one who
granted him all that power!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why, you...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I may not be <Hugo>'s biggest fan...
But I'll never forgive you for what
you did to him!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
Heh heh heh... It seems that
Belcrant is ready to fire.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
The putrid Er'ther Lands shall
be consumed by darkness!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
Under my rule, a paradise shall
be established for the glorious
Aetherians!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm not gonna let you do that!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmph, a useless exercise in futility.
...Allow me to show you!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
Haaaaah!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Light from <Belserius>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
//TODO check second line
<center>Such tremendous pressure... 
<Belserius>' power is off the charts!

Now that the cannon has been
primed, I shall revel in the
destruction it brings!
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
You are not my equal.
Do you understand now?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
The Eye of Atamoni...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
Bear witness as your Er'ther
Lands fade into darkness!
[ENDBLOCK]

Stop this!
[ENDBLOCK]

Belcrant, fire!

We've come so far...
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Dammit!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
Victory! Victory for
the Aetherian Army!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm going to make your death
quick. You should be grateful.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
I, the King of the Aetherians,
shall personally deliver my
judgment.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
First, you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're giving me special treatment?
I'm so grateful, it brings tears to
my eyes.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo> has always been
concerned about you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
Even after taking over his
body, a sliver of <Hugo>'s
consciousness remained.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
Therefore, I could sense every bit
of pain felt within his heart. He
agonized over you constantly.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
He held out hope that there
was still a way he could be
a father to you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
What a vulgar way to think!
I couldn't help but be amused!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
And there's nothing you can
do about it, is there? How
unfortunate. Ha-ha-ha!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Shut your damn mouth...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's that?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Aetherians are no different
from Er'thers, but you're the
only exception, huh!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You have no humanity!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
How can someone like YOU be
better than the Er'thers!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
To think someone would dare
laugh at familial love!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
Shut your mouth.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Gah!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
You cheeky little worm.
I'll deal with you next.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character
parameters that can be set. 
The specific method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, press <Square_ani> to 
change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen will be
[Titles]. Press <Triangle_ani> to pick from
all acquired titles.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Titles serve two purposes:
The first is to [affect dialogue 
when talking to NPCs].
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Set a title to have certain NPCs interested
while passing them. When talking with NPCs
multiple times you may get different responses.
Change the title and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to certain NPCs, a [?] will 
appear over the character's head. If this 
happens, set a title that seems to be related
to the dialogue, and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose for titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
