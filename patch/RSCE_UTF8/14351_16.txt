<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
I... wanted to guide Phandaria
into a new era...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
One where all is ruled by the
people, not just one king...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right... You would always
talk so passionately about that...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
You'd always say that in order for this
country to truly progress, the rights of
the people must be elevated.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>That way of thinking is never a mistake.
This man is truly ahead of his time.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
But... my past self
was far too hasty...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
I was so preoccupied with
implementing this reform,
that I simply demanded it
outright.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
Of course that wasn't enough to
persuade King Isaac. He also had
a lot on his shoulders.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
The me of two years
ago just wasn't able
to understand that...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>So in order to try to force this
reform, he threatened an uprising...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is all because of my carelessness.
<Mary>... I'm sorry you got caught up in it...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't say that... I'm just
happy to see you again...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>, after I lost you, I was
captured and imprisoned.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
Over the following two years,
I realized something...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
A military uprising
would be futile.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
When <Greybum> freed me,
I thought for sure, this
time...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
...This time, I would surely
realize my ideals, the right
way...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
But...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
Reality is never so simple.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>'s methods are brutal...
At this rate, Phandaria... will...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
So that's why you told <Mary>
to get out of the country...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...But if that's what you felt, why
were you still helping <Greybum>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
...When he freed me, <Greybum>
had already been working with
my comrades...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't think this will last long.
Eventually, the rebellion will be
quelled.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
When that happens, someone will
have to take responsibility. That
person will be me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you saying you'll take all of
the blame, so the other rebels 
won't be punished...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You can't do that!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>! You have to consider
<Mary>'s feelings, here!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
She went through so much
to get her memory back, to
remember you!

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character
parameters that can be set. 
The specific method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, press <Square_ani> to 
change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen will be
[Titles]. Press <Triangle_ani> to pick from
all acquired titles.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Titles serve two purposes:
The first is to [affect dialogue 
when talking to NPCs].
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Set a title to have certain NPCs interested
while passing them. When talking with NPCs
multiple times you may get different responses.
Change the title and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to certain NPCs, a [?] will 
appear over the character's head. If this 
happens, set a title that seems to be related
to the dialogue, and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose for titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
