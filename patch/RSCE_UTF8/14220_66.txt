<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character
parameters that can be set. 
The specific method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, press <Square_ani> to 
change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen will be
[Titles]. Press <Triangle_ani> to pick from
all acquired titles.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Titles serve two purposes:
The first is to [affect dialogue 
when talking to NPCs].
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Set a title to have certain NPCs interested
while passing them. When talking with NPCs
multiple times you may get different responses.
Change the title and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to certain NPCs, a [?] will 
appear over the character's head. If this 
happens, set a title that seems to be related
to the dialogue, and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose for titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>[Rock Rally] is a game in which

to clear certain objectives.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007><x0E><x01><x00><x00><x00>Here are the basic rules.
1: Kicking a rock outside the
	city will start the game.
2: Battles don't affect the clearing
	objective of the Rock Rally game.
3: The rock will return to its original
	location when you enter or leave
	a city or dungeon.

[ENDBLOCK]
Ahh... A hot spring in the middle
of the snow... How poetic.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
You got that right! This
is how warriors relax!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Aah... Indeed, it's good to
take a rest now and then.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Think <Rutee> and the others
are enjoying this, too?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wow, <Mary>, you're really something.
Just what do you eat to get like that?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're so flexible, too...
C'mon, what's your secret?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I... guess it's
just in my blood.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm so jealous! Oh well, at least
I got <Chelsea> beat. No surprise
there though, eh?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wh-What!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't tease me, Miss <Rutee>!
You know I'm still growing!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Besides, I bet you wouldn't be saying
that if you were 14 too, hehe~!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, you~!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, <Philia>, where do
you think you're going!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>, please don't run!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
N-No, please, stooop!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ughh! I can't
take it anymore!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wh-What's wrong?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, my boy. Do you know
why men climb mountains?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't women climb
them, too?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's because the mountain is in
front of them! That's why, right!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Uhm...
I guess...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
C'mon, you're a
man too, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then let's scale this
mountain together!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Since I'm your senior here,
I'll go first. Try to keep up!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Come on, it'll be fine!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Even if we get separated, we'll
surely meet again at the top!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now let's aim
for the summit!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
The summit's on the other side of
this wall. You can see it through
this crack right here!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
K-<Kongman>, this is awful!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oooops, sorrry~!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Looks like <Atwight> slipped out of my
hand and right through that crack~!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
GYAAAAAAAA!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Did you think you were being sneaky,
blurting out your plan like that?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well ya didn't have to stab
me in the head with a sword!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
The men's side is on the left,
the girls side is on the right.
Well then, shall we go?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey <Stahn>, no peeking~!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I-I won't, I promise!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
You don't need to tell us!
We'll already know you're
in the bath, so... hehehe...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wh-What!? What's with
that creepy look...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Gahahahaha!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Not sure why, but I feel
sick to my stomach.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now now, there's no need
for that, <Kongman>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
You too, <Rutee>. Let's
hurry to the baths.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Very well, let's go.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Haah... This feels incredible.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Whew~! It's so good
for the skin, too!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Mhm, it's good for
my tired bones, too!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>, you sound
like an old man, hehe.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't dare show this
side to King <Woodrow>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Gyah! C-Cold!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Gaahahaha! Whaddaya think
of my Mighty Snowball!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
OUCH! <Johnny>!!
Was that you!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>, don't you
dare aim that at me!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Those guys are
nothin' but children...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
King <Woodrow>'s also
havin' fun. It's so cute!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder what causes men to
act so childish sometimes?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's truly a mystery...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Woaah! <Kongman>,
that's big!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Gahahah! You got that right,
<Stahn>! I'm the Champion,
after all!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Haha, even so, <Stahn>'s
is so small and cute.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, well. What about
<Woodrow>...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
WOAHH it's HUUUUGE!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
H-How could I have lost...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've never seen one so
big in my entire life!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ahh, that was refreshing.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Perhaps I should invite
<Darzen> next time...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's wrong? Why
is everyone staring
at me like that?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's that same look <Kongman>
was giving before going in...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, n-nope, it's nothing!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's nothing at all!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't worry about it!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's with them
all of a sudden?
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]

what if you pulled your towel up, and...
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Aaah, that was wonderful.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
We should come
back again soon.
