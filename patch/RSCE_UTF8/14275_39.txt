[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm?
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Is this about father?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Father?
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Father lived in a very hot
place when he was a child.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
And where is your father now?
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Father died in the last war.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...I'm sorry.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't be. Seeing someone looking
for him brings me joy.
[ENDBLOCK]

Are you travelers?
Better not cause any trouble.

[ENDBLOCK]
We only want what's best for this

[ENDBLOCK]

Could you be...
Your Majesty... King <Woodrow>...?
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Declaring war on the entire
Earth...? Are they serious?
[ENDBLOCK]

That thing blasted holes all over the

I was instructed by captain

Your Majesty <Woodrow>,
please save humanity.

[ENDBLOCK]
We will mold Phandaria
anew by our own hands!

Captain <Dalis> negotiated with the new
king to ensure we weren't punished.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
What are the Aeth'er Wars?

[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder how many would die

How am I supposed to rest when all

may strike at any moment?
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
We will do what we can here.
Please, save the world!
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
We won the fight because Lord
<Greybum> was on our side.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
People were praising Lord
<Greybum> before, but now
they're all badmouthing him.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
In the end, the grown-ups are
just putting all the blame on
Lord <Greybum>.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
The sky is looking weird.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
The sky flashed and made a
loud sound out of nowhere.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
What will we do if the
whole sky is blocked?
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
We sent all our lens to Heidelberg.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
When did we start being
friendly to outsiders?
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
If everybody joins forces together,
we will definitely win.

Ngh... Walking on a snow-covered

[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Has this town also fallen
into rebel hands...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll wait outside of town
for now. There could be
a commotion if I'm seen.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll go with you.

Rebel Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
You guys don't look familiar.
Who are you?
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Uhmmm...
[ENDBLOCK]
Isn't that <Mary>!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do I know you?
[ENDBLOCK]
What are you saying? We 
were comrades in arms 
together, remember?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
We... fought together...?
[ENDBLOCK]
I thought you died in the battle two
years ago! Damn, I can't believe it.
[ENDBLOCK]
I gotta let the captain
know! Wait here!
[ENDBLOCK]
???
[ENDBLOCK]
Did something happen?
[ENDBLOCK]
Captain <Dalis>! Good, you're here!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ma...!
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
...And you are?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
Could you be...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
They look alike, but
it can't be her.
[ENDBLOCK]
It just... isn't possible...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
We are returning to Heidelberg.
You two, come with me.
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, sir.
[ENDBLOCK]
U-Understood.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
As soon as you are done with your
business here, leave. Get out of this
country as soon as possible.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you maybe an acquaintance
of <Mary>'s?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wait a second. You are...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
You've been warned.
Next time there will 
be no warning.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Did you remember something
about him, <Mary>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't know... I don't know, but...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>, are you okay!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
My head is hurting a
little... but I'm fine.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>This place seems to be strongly
connected to her. Being here seems
to be unlocking her memories.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
This city is...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>, go call <Woodrow> and the
others. They can now enter the
city without drawing attention.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Understood.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
If it isn't <Mary>! When
did you come back?
[ENDBLOCK]
You seem to be in good health.
I thought you had died!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
U-...Umm...
[ENDBLOCK]
Good things keep happening!
We took the capital, and even
managed to kill Isaac!
[ENDBLOCK]
Maybe this is also Lord <Greybum>'s
influence. He seems to be a magnet
for good fortune.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Did you say Lord <Greybum>...?
[ENDBLOCK]
Will you be going back
to your house, <Mary>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
My house...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>'s house? Where!?
[ENDBLOCK]
It's on the west side of
town, and its walls are
green. You can't miss it...
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, I was in the middle
of shopping. Well then,
I'll see you later.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
It appears that members of the
royal family are not welcome in
this city...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
The things she said... 
How horrible...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't let it get to you. I'm sure
<Greybum> deceived everyone.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm afraid it isn't that simple.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What do you mean?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
There are people in this country
who are receptive to <Greybum>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
This town might be
a rebel army base.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>Be that as it may, it's better not
to overstay. Let's leave as soon
as we are done resupplying.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Before that... <Mary>, what do
you want to do? Want to try
going to your house?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
...I do. There's a chance going
might help me remember.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Certainly. Let's go, guys. 
We gotta make sure what
that woman said is true.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center><Woodrow> is with us. It's best to
avoid unnecessary actions.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is not unnecessary.
It's important.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, we can't
just leave it be.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
 ...If it's unavoidable,
then hurry up and go.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Lord <Woodrow>, is
something wrong?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
My father was famously
known as the "Wise King."
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why did he have such an unyielding
attitude towards Cyril...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I apologize... That is a question I'll
have to find an answer for myself.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
And I suppose I won't succeed to the
throne until I have that answer.

On this screen, press <Square_ani> to

<TAG_007>At the top of this screen will be
[Titles]. Press <Triangle_ani> to pick from

<TAG_007>Titles serve two purposes:
The first is to [affect dialogue 
when talking to NPCs].
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Set a title to have certain NPCs interested
while passing them. When talking with NPCs
multiple times you may get different responses.
Change the title and try talking to them again.

Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to certain NPCs, a [?] will 
appear over the character's head. If this 
happens, set a title that seems to be related
to the dialogue, and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose for titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
