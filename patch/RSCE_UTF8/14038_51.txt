Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
Yo, it's been a while!
How was Seinegald?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I think you may have mistaken
me for someone else.
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
Come on, stop jerking my chain. I
want to hear about your travels.
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
You really aren't
him, are you?
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
Sorry about that...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's all right. No harm, no foul.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do I really look that similar
to this gentleman you know?
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, you could be twins.
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
If anyone who knew him saw
you, they would have quite
the reaction.
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
Although last time I saw him, he
sure left town in quite a rush...
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
If you want to know more about
him, you should find his friends.
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
I bet they'd mistake you
for him just like I did.

[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome to the arena, the temple
of entertainment. Here, you'll enjoy
blood-boiling battles!
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
I saw some smoke coming
from the city park. What's
going on?
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
What was with
those monsters?
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
Wh-What's
going on?
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
Our champion! We'll keep the
arena going, no matter what!
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
Until the champion returns, the arena
will remain a beacon of light!
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
Whether you want to watch or
participate, it's up to you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
What's going on...?
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
It's not typical for
monsters to attack
a city.
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
They're attacking
from the sky!
That's cheating!
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
We're still open for business, but
I'm not sure how long we'll last...
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm looking forward to the day
when the champion will make
his triumphant return!

But, when i-it comes down to it, I'm
t-too freaked out to go in there.
[ENDBLOCK]
Armored Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I t-thought I heard someone scream...
I hope it was j-just my imagination!
[ENDBLOCK]
Armored Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I-I helped with the
evacuation, too!
[ENDBLOCK]
Armored Man
[ENDBLOCK]
T-The champion! Can
I get an autograph?
[ENDBLOCK]
Armored Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Y-Yeah! I-I'll go in this
time, for s-sure!
[ENDBLOCK]
Armored Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder if the sky looks
like this everywhere now...
[ENDBLOCK]
Armored Man
[ENDBLOCK]
What kinda person goes to the
arena at a time like this?
[ENDBLOCK]
Armored Man
[ENDBLOCK]
As usual, I'm just loitering out
here, not doing anything.
[ENDBLOCK]
Armored Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm starting to think I'll never be able
to compete in the arena again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Armored Man

I don't care if I'm just
a cheerleader! Mighty,
Mighty, Mighty!
