Young Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Keep your eyes to
yourself, foreigner.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Man
[ENDBLOCK]
There are weird things floating in
the sky. What the hell's goin' on!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm gonna die on this
horrid rock of an island...
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm not going to die so easily.
I'll forge my own path through life!
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
I came all the way here to stock
up, but the vendors here just
kinda glare at me...
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
That voice from the sky
scared the heck out of me!
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
Sheesh! I thought that a meteorite
fell or something, it scared me!
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
The sky has been
completely covered...
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
Folks here are a lot nicer now.
It's thanks to you guys, y'know!
[ENDBLOCK]
Blonde Sailor
[ENDBLOCK]
I'd usually be thrilled to finally
dock somewhere. Not here though...
[ENDBLOCK]
Blonde Sailor
[ENDBLOCK]
It's like a mesh screen floating in the
sky. They call it the Aethersphere.
[ENDBLOCK]
Blonde Sailor
[ENDBLOCK]
It's not a net... It's like the sky
was covered with a ceiling.
[ENDBLOCK]
Blonde Sailor
[ENDBLOCK]
If the world returns to normal,
maybe we'll be able to get along
with the people of Calvalese.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sailor
[ENDBLOCK]
Why are we lingering
here? We should get
going already...
[ENDBLOCK]
Sailor
[ENDBLOCK]
So the Aethersphere is made of chunks
of earth lifted to the sky by lightning?
[ENDBLOCK]
Sailor
[ENDBLOCK]
They're uneven, as if they were
just ripped out at random...
[ENDBLOCK]
Captain
[ENDBLOCK]
Is the Leviathan like the Draconis?
I'd love to ride either one someday...
[ENDBLOCK]
Captain
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you going to Neustadt?
[ENDBLOCK]
Captain
[ENDBLOCK]
Even at a time like this,
you want to take a boat?
[ENDBLOCK]
Captain
[ENDBLOCK]
Captain
[ENDBLOCK]
Where do you want to go?
Hurry up!

Black-Haired Sailor
[ENDBLOCK]
The people here have never
taken kindly to tourists.
[ENDBLOCK]
Black-Haired Sailor
[ENDBLOCK]
My family is in Seinegald.
I wonder if they're safe?

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character
parameters that can be set. 
The specific method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, press <Square_ani> to 
change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen will be
[Titles]. Press <Triangle_ani> to pick from
all acquired titles.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Titles serve two purposes:
The first is to [affect dialogue 
when talking to NPCs].
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Set a title to have certain NPCs interested
while passing them. When talking with NPCs
multiple times you may get different responses.
Change the title and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to certain NPCs, a [?] will 
appear over the character's head. If this 
happens, set a title that seems to be related
to the dialogue, and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose for titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
[ENDBLOCK]
