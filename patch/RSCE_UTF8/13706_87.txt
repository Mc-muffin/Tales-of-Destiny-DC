You must head to Straylize

[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
You must do whatever it takes
to regain the Eye of Atamoni.
I'm counting on you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you for your efforts.
I'll see you upon your return.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm counting on you, <Lion>.

You must do whatever it takes

[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Getting the Eye of Atamoni back is
our first priority. Don't forget that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>... have you been deceiving
me this entire time?
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Swordian Masters, save Cresta.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Everyone, I know you are tired,
but please go see <Reynolds>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Our country will do everything in
our power to support your actions.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've arranged for you to stay at the
town's inn. I hope you get some rest.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
We've done all we can do. It's
up to you now, my friends.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
We must not, by any chance, fail to
meet His Majesty's expectations.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Cresta is a city east
of the royal capital.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
When you reach the city, look for the
soldiers we have stationed there.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
We must not, by any chance, fail to
meet His Majesty's expectations.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
If only the Seven Generals
had been here, this would
not have happened.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now that I think about it, the deployment
of the Seven Generals was also <Hugo>'s
idea.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Because of <Hugo>, I regretfully made
myself an enemy of my country.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll send military help immediately.
I need you to hold out until then.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds> wants to talk to you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
The entrance to the laboratory is
in the courtyard of the castle.
Be careful.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
We are sending out requests
to every city in the country
and collecting lens.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm very sorry for asking
so much of you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
The operation is scheduled to
take place tomorrow morning.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
I believe you will be victorious,
Swordian masters.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
This is the audience
chamber.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Everyone, make haste
to the courtyard.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Please proceed to His
Majesty's throne.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
The ship I arranged for you will
be docked at Darilsheid port.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
Be careful out there, <Mary>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
Take care of <Mary>
for me, <Woodrow>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
Please take care of <Mary>.
Leave Phandaria to me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
The Aetherian King, <Miktran>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes. He is the self-appointed ruler of
the Aetherians, and the one solely
responsible for this crisis.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>'s theft of the Eye of Atamoni...
and <Hugo>'s assault upon the Earth...
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
The Aethersphere hiding the sky...
Even <Greybum>'s rebellion...
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
You mean to say that these events
were all part of <Miktran>'s plan?
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Tell me more of this Aetherian King.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
In a single word - overwhelming.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
An aura of unimaginable force
radiated from him. He was able
to control <Belserius> with ease.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've never seen anything like it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
All we could do was run.
He was just too strong.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
If only we had been able to
recover the Eye... I have
never felt so incompetent.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
You are not to blame. Our country
needs to be held accountable.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Our failure to see <Hugo> for what
he truly was and our blind trust in
him is what has brought us here.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
Instead of dwelling on the past,
think about what is yet to come.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
By some twist of fate, the leaders
of the three countries are present.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
We should establish an alliance
among our nations and come up
with countermeasures.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Another Aeth'er War...
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
If you have any recommendations for
a course of action, Swordian Masters,
I would like to hear them.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
We'll go up again.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Many times if we have to. We will not
give up until we defeat <Miktran>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Right, <Dymlos>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, that's right.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
E-Everyone...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're all beat up.
What happened?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sorry, but Radisrol has fallen...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
What?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
We tried our best, but they
ultimately overwhelmed us...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
We can't even use the 
zero-gravity elevator 
anymore.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
What happened to <Ritora>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
The commander is...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Get him patched up!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
If Radisrol is truly lost, we
have no means to return.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
No way...!
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Pardon the intrusion.
It's an emergency!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
What is it now!?
[ENDBLOCK]
The troops stationed at Cresta
are requesting assistance!
[ENDBLOCK]
A horde of monsters has descended
from the sky. They're under attack!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Cresta?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>Not only does he cast us into darkness,
he wants to eradicate us as well.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Did he deliberately target a place
where defenses are weak?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
No way... You've got
to be kidding me!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I need to do something.
I have to go back now!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
You alone are no match for
the horde. I'll start preparing
a relief force immediately.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't trust they'll
get there in time!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wait, <Rutee>! I'm 
coming with you!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Not just me... 
but all of us.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
The current situation
is dire.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
It would be better for all
of us to handle it. We are
able to mobilize quickly.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Very well. I leave it to you.
We'll dispatch our forces as
soon as they're ready.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm coming with you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
You need all the help you can get.
Though it may be lacking, I will
lend you my strength.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Besides, we can't have a proper
team without representation
from Aquaveil, could we?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
We've already discussed it. Please
don't hesitate to call upon me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you, that's
very helpful.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
All right. Let's hurry
over to Cresta!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm glad you're okay.
I was worried.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're looking
well too, <Mary>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>, I wasn't expecting you.
What's going on in our country?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
We have been able to hold back the
monster raids across our lands.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see... I'm relieved
to hear that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
I came here because I was asked to
make a delivery for Sir <Darzen>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you remember the dragon that
attacked the castle during the
last <Greybum> revolt?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
With some modifications, we were
able to make it rideable. We have
dubbed it the "Avitus Draconis." 
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Amazing... I didn't think
that was even possible.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
Though it may appear to be similar
to the Draconis, it is not capable
of high altitude flight.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
"Please use it as you see fit. I trust
Your Majesty will use it wisely."
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
That is the message
from Sir <Darzen>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's currently parked outside 
the city. You should see it 
for yourself.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
...I understand. I'll
put it to good use.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>This "Avitus Draconis" should make
traveling more efficient.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>We might be able to use it to
travel to the Swordian R&D Lab.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I feel like the winds of fate
are beginning to change.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's usually when the
luck comes around.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you, <Dalis>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
Please take care of <Mary>.
Leave Phandaria to me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
I haven't forgotten what
you said to me, <Woodrow>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
So come back safely... 
Safely to our homeland,
Phandaria.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
...I promise you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Swordian Team. Does this mean
we have a plan of action?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
First, we travel to the Swordian
R&D Lab to bolster our strength.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
After that, we will go to Junkland
and get the Berselium.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
In the meantime, I will be working
on the Integrated Lens Cannon in
the courtyard of the castle.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
With the help of His Excellency <Dryden>,
arrangements are being made to assist
us in procuring lens.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
We are already calling on all towns
and villages in the country to offer
their lens.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
I understand. My country will do
everything in our power to help 
support your actions.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
I feel bad that I can't do anything
myself, but I will spare no effort
to help.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm counting on you, everyone.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay. Then we'll head to
the Swordian R&D Lab!
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Everyone of the Swordian Team.
Thank you for all your hard work.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
The Integrated Lens Cannon is complete.
At long last, we are ready to strike back.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
We'll launch the operation
tomorrow morning.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
Tomorrow...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Tomorrow!
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Therefore, I would like you all
to get a good night's rest.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've arranged for you to stay at
the town's inn. I hope you're able
to rest well.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
I know you really want to go back
to visit your homelands, but we 
don't have time. I'm sorry.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, sir. Thank you for your concern.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, let's head into the city for now.
Flapping our gums in front of the
throne is discourteous.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, Sir <Lion>.
You've finally
returned.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
The king has already gone to bed.
So, how did the investigation go?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I was able to confirm the
existence of the powerful,
unidentified monsters.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see. Then I will send
in the troops at once.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, that won't be necessary.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I believe I've wiped out all
the monsters that were in
the area.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, now, all on
your own, hm?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, I had <Chaltier> to assist me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Mmh, I see. As expected
of a Swordian, I suppose.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll be sure to report your excellent
work to His Majesty on your behalf.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
I feel kind of embarrassed
when <Dryden> praises us...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>'s very pleased as well.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Moving on, Sir <Lion>. Have
you any idea as to where
the monsters came from?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
All of them came
out of the ocean.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Maybe something happened
at the bottom of the ocean.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see. I will have this matter
investigated. Thank you for
your help, Sir <Lion>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I shall take my leave now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
One moment, <Lion>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
What is it, sir?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Soon, the Seven Generals are
having a conference. Well...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Well, what, sir?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
As a Hedge Knight, your involvement
in the castle's inner affairs have thus
far been limited.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Therefore, I would like to introduce
you to the other Generals.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you sure you want
me to be there?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Should I take that response
as approval?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, absolutely, sir!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see. It's starting to get late. Let's
continue this discussion tomorrow.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Very well. I'll
be going now.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character
parameters that can be set. 
The specific method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, press <Square_ani> to 
change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen will be
[Titles]. Press <Triangle_ani> to pick from
all acquired titles.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Titles serve two purposes:
The first is to [affect dialogue 
when talking to NPCs].
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Set a title to have certain NPCs interested
while passing them. When talking with NPCs
multiple times you may get different responses.
Change the title and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to certain NPCs, a [?] will 
appear over the character's head. If this 
happens, set a title that seems to be related
to the dialogue, and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose for titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick

<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Your Majesty, I present to
you the Seven Generals.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's been months since last we've
had you all gather like this.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Leen>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, Your Majesty? What
do you want this time!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lewein>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Leen>, how dare you speak to
His Majesty in such a way?
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hahahaha. Pay it no mind. <Leen>,
you haven't changed at all.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Melina>
[ENDBLOCK]
Your Majesty, perhaps you
shouldn't spoil <Leen> so.
[ENDBLOCK]
Leen
[ENDBLOCK]
Well look at you, Miss <Melina>.
Making a power grab, are you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Melina>
[ENDBLOCK]
Idiot! That's not what I-
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>
[ENDBLOCK]
Come on, you two, calm down.
It's clear <Leen> likes you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's why he's always
picking on you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Melina>
[ENDBLOCK]
Cut it out! The very idea
of it gives me the creeps!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ascus>
[ENDBLOCK]
I thought it was the dream
of women everywhere for
<Leen> to fall for them!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Leen>
[ENDBLOCK]
Indeed, <Ascus>!
Well said, sir!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
You are in the presence of
the king! Behave yourselves!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lewein>
[ENDBLOCK]
Anyway, Your Majesty, as <Leen>
also asked, what's the reason you
called us all together like this?
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is it wrong of me to
not have a reason?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lewein>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's not what
I meant!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Leen>
[ENDBLOCK]
Someone's in trouble~!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Melina>
[ENDBLOCK]
Come on, <Leen>!
Say something, <Ascus>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ascus>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm pretty busy, myself. If
there's no reason, then...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Melina>
[ENDBLOCK]
By the Goddess, even <Ascus>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>
[ENDBLOCK]
Calm down, <Melina>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hahaha! You are correct. I should
have considered that from the start.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Therefore, I shall call for
you all again at another,
less busy occasion.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Your Majesty...
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
My apologies. You
are dismissed.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
I never thought the world
would turn out like this.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
We'll take care
of it, I promise.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, that's not it...
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
I am grieved that
I have no heir.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Heir...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
His Majesty's successor.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
I have no doubt that you will restore
the world to its former glory...
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
However, I don't know if I will ever
be able to see this peaceful country
again with my own eyes.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
As expected, he...
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Somebody! Get the <Queen>
and <Ashley> down here.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>, reporting for duty.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
I apologize for summoning
you here.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>, you have been called here
today for a singular purpose.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
The <Queen> and I have been speaking
on this matter for quite some time.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let me be blunt. Will you
become my heir?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>
[ENDBLOCK]
What...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Queen>
[ENDBLOCK]
My husband and I were not blessed
with any children. Therefore...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>
[ENDBLOCK]
A-Are you sure this is a good idea?
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Without a doubt. I had originally
offered this to <Finlay>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
If you are truly <Finlay>'s
little brother, it is the
only obvious choice.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>
[ENDBLOCK]
<S12>(...yet again, my brother...)
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
What do you say?
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, <Ashley>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>
[ENDBLOCK]
<S12>(...I...am not a substitute...)
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now, let's hear your answer.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sorry, Your Majesty. I'm afraid
I must decline your offer.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Queen>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why is that, <Ashley>?

[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>
[ENDBLOCK]
If you'll excuse me...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Queen>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
I never thought the world would
turn out like this. If only his
brother were here...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
He always maintained his composure,
but I know that within his soul there
was a burning passion.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>, who are
you talking about?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>, he's a friend of
my brother's, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, yeah.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo> was an insatiable
man, but...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
I had high hopes for <Lion>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
But now, he's dead!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I always thought that you
loathed <Lion>, Mr. <Dryden>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
That is not true.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
I had thought I would be able to retire
once he had matured a little more.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
We had planned to have
<Lion> serve as the new
Seventh General.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion> as a general!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
But that dream has
all but faded...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
He always maintained his composure,
but I know that within his soul there
was a burning passion. <x00>
