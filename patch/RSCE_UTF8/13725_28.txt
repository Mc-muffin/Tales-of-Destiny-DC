Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
You've been in and out of
the mansion a lot recently.
Do you live there?
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
I haven't seen Oberon's CEO
or his butler for a while now.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
This is the mansion of Oberon's
CEO. Isn't it magnificent?
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
I haven't seen Oberon's CEO
or his butler for a while now.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
The moun... The mountain is gone!
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
You mean to tell me Oberon's CEO
is the mastermind behind this?
You've got to be kidding me!
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
If Oberon is truly responsible,
then the entire company should
be shut down.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Is it true that the secret weapon
being built within the castle uses
a lot of lens?
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Whenever I hear the word "lens,"
I can't help but think of the
Oberon Corporation.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
The secret lens weapon has nothing
to do with Oberon, does it?
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Everyone is relying on you!
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
It has not been publicly disclosed
that Master <Lion> is the CEO's son.
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
Stay vigilant and report any
suspicious individuals.
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
Every time I hear about Master
<Lion>'s activities, I want to brag
about him to someone.
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
Mr. <Hugo> is now an important asset
to our country. I am here to ensure
his safety.
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
I've been relieved of my duties to
guard <Hugo>'s mansion. This is a
direct order from my superiors.
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
And yet, out of habit,
I'm still here.
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
It was Mr. <Hugo> who was
broadcasting. As soon as
I heard his voice, I knew.
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
Betraying one's country is a serious
crime. I'll never forgive <Hugo>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
I was ordered to watch over the
estate. As such, I will not leave
this post.
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>, who works at the
mansion, is waiting for
someone to come home.
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't think there's anyone
who would come back to this
mansion now.
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>, who works at the
mansion, is waiting for
someone to come home.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
A life free from the influence of
lens. I can't even imagine it.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
The CEO of Oberon, <Hugo>,
has so many magnificent 
achievements.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
In a former life, before Mr. <Rembrandt>
found me, I was a lens hunter.

Apprentice
[ENDBLOCK]
Good morning!
[ENDBLOCK]
Apprentice
[ENDBLOCK]
I may still be an apprentice,
but I am eager to assist.
[ENDBLOCK]
Apprentice
[ENDBLOCK]
Ugh. I'm still an apprentice...
[ENDBLOCK]
Apprentice
[ENDBLOCK]
Did you hear the latest gossip?
Apparently, Master <Lion> is in
fact, this mansion's...
[ENDBLOCK]
Apprentice
[ENDBLOCK]
I-I'm sorry! It's nothing.
Forget I said anything!
[ENDBLOCK]
Apprentice
[ENDBLOCK]
They won't even let us whisper
in the manor. These rules are
suffocating...
[ENDBLOCK]
Apprentice
[ENDBLOCK]
I saw a light falling from
far up in the sky.
[ENDBLOCK]
Apprentice
[ENDBLOCK]
Such an amazing light, I've never
seen anything like it before.
[ENDBLOCK]
Apprentice
[ENDBLOCK]
Now that the master and butler are
gone, the residence has gone to pot.
[ENDBLOCK]
Apprentice
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sure I won't even get paid
for all the work I've done...
[ENDBLOCK]
Apprentice
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian> has returned, but there's
something different about her.
[ENDBLOCK]
Apprentice
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian> insisted that I help
take lens to the castle.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome home, Master <Lion>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
All right, I'm pumped up! Let's
hurry to Hayrise Temple!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>That's "Straylize!" At least
remember the name!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I just remembered something.
Wait here a second.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
That took too long!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
All right. Let's get moving.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Not even gonna apologize for
making us wait for you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you have a Poison Charm?
You'll need them from here on.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Chal. Explain it to them.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>You can make jewels
with materials via Rerise.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>Not only can they prevent ailments, 
but they'll also increase your stats,
and some carry other abilities.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>Also, you can repeatedly Rerise a gem,
thus increasing their effects on your stats.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
So materials become gems, and
you can strengthen them, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
See for yourself. Here.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I did it!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>It's a good idea to
Rerise materials often.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wait a moment, <Lion>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
I almost forgot to give
you your allowance.
Here, take this.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Thank you, sir.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Of course.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
He's so polite to his dad.
My family's completely
different...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...I'm home, <Marian>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome back, Emilio.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Emilio, are you leaving?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't expect to be long.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well then, I'll have dinner
ready for you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay, I'll be going now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Emilio, wait a moment, please.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...What is it, <Marian>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, Emilio, there's something
on my mind, if you don't mind
me telling you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
S-Sure...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
The way you spoke to that
soldier earlier, that wasn't
very appropriate.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Even though you outrank him,
he was still your senior.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
No one will want to follow your
command if you keep that up.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I... but that's... he was...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
He was what, exactly?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
You need to remember what's
expected of someone of your
rank.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I... understand. I'll
be more careful.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, as long as you understand,
I'm glad that I told you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay, that's all. Please
be careful, and come
back safe.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character
parameters that can be set. 
The specific method is as follows.

<TAG_007>At the top of this screen will be
[Titles]. Press <Triangle_ani> to pick from

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Titles serve two purposes:
The first is to [affect dialogue 
when talking to NPCs].
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Set a title to have certain NPCs interested
while passing them. When talking with NPCs
multiple times you may get different responses.
Change the title and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to certain NPCs, a [?] will 
appear over the character's head. If this 
happens, set a title that seems to be related
to the dialogue, and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose for titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
