[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, please forgive
me. Hahaha.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
After all, we're
just gabbing...
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, you there. I haven't seen your
face around here before, have I?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Who knows. I'm from the city
of Cyril in Phandaria.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
My, is this your husband?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
W-What!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Nope. My husband
is in Cyril.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
Is that so? Sorry for
the misunderstanding.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't worry about it. More
importantly, what were you
talking about just now?
[ENDBLOCK]
Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
Nothing in particular. Just the
idle gossip of older women.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
The topic of the hour
is General <Dryden>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
He's a little scary, isn't he?
[ENDBLOCK]
Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, it's true that some
people do think that.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
But he's a very popular
person in Darilsheid.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Really?
[ENDBLOCK]
Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right. Despite working for the
military, he's always concerned about
the safety and happiness of others.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I had no idea.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
What an unexpected tidbit. Next time
we see him, we'll have to tease him
about it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Tease him? <Mary>... That's
totally a <Rutee> thing.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lens Shopkeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
This pains me to say to our customers,
but we are not currently cashing lens.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh... How come?
[ENDBLOCK]
Lens Shopkeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
Uhm... about that...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Come on! At this rate,
we'll run out of Gald.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>. I can't believe
this. Ask him why!
[ENDBLOCK]
Lens Shopkeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
This pains me to say to our customers,
but we are not currently cashing lens.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't even...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
W-We... uhm, we only have
until tomorrow to pay off
our debts... or else...
[ENDBLOCK]
Lens Shopkeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
Really?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What kind of question is that?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
We have to settle this
debt right away.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Otherwise, there may not
be a tomorrow for us...
[ENDBLOCK]
Lens Shopkeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
Even if that were true...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now, I'd like to know the reason
why we can't cash in our lens.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lens Shopkeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
...If you go to the Oberon CEO's
house, you'll quickly see why.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>'s House?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
It can't be...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]

I don't really like Mr. <Hugo>. Sure,
he's a successful businessman, but
there's something "off" about him...
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
It's peaceful today.
[ENDBLOCK]
Grandpa
[ENDBLOCK]
General <Dryden> is a wonderful man.
I will not allow anyone to deny it.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
What the hell? I'm pretty
sure that voice is...!
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Um, do you know my grandfather?
he used to hang around here.

He just suddenly went somewhere.
I hope he's all right...

The other day, I was stung by

It was a terrible experience.

Hey mama. Let's go on a picnic

The number of <Lion>'s fans

I fell in love with him first.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey mama. Let's go on a picnic

[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
There's a lot of soldiers
in the city. I wonder why?
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
I hope <Lion> wipes out
all the bad guys.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
I went to the castle and delivered
some lens. I was helpful, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, <Lion>? I was just
talking about you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you <Lion>? Wow, you're a
beautiful guy even up close!
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>! I heard you've completed
your important mission.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh my, I can't believe you're
talking to me, <Lion>. You're
really a cutie, you know.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
I saw the rumored <Lion> the
other day. I had no idea he
was so beautiful.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
A soldier told me that that
<Lion> has completed another
important mission.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
I haven't seen <Lion> lately, I wonder
if he's gone to some far-off place.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>, where have you run off
to at such a terrible time?
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
There are rumors that <Lion> 
was a bad guy, but I don't 
believe them.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
Make a hole in that
damn Aethersphere!
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't you dare lose!
[ENDBLOCK]
Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>, I wish you great success. 
After all, the era of the Seven
Generals is over.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder if I'll dry
my futon today.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
I think <Lion> will soon be elected to
become one of the Seven Generals.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>, I wish you great success. 
After all, the era of the Seven
Generals is over.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder if I'll dry

[ENDBLOCK]
Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
The castle seems to be
in a state of unrest.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
The voice that came from the sky,
it sounded familiar somehow?
[ENDBLOCK]
Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
I heard that it was Oberon's
CEO who was broadcasting
from the sky.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder what will happen
to Seinegald now...
[ENDBLOCK]
Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
Please make the world
go back to normal.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Rumor has it that the Draconis
was attacked by monsters.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
It seems that it was in the
process of carrying some
very important cargo!
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you have any interesting gossip?
I'm bored out of my mind.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
There's a rumor that the two countries
have buried something together near
their shared border.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Everywhere you go in town these days,
people are talking about <Lion> Magnus.

DIDN'T talk about him.

[ENDBLOCK]
You guys seem to know
what's happening. Tell
me what's going on!
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
If the sunlight disappears, the ground
will freeze in the blink of an eye...
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I hear they're building a top
secret weapon in the castle
to breach the Aethersphere.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Damn, why...? When I saw that light,
I couldn't hold back my tears.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's likely Seinegald isn't the only
place where this is happening.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
I reckon that monsters are
attacking people all across
the world at the same time. 
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's not just <Rutee>. We're all
worried about our families
and our hometowns.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
And yet, here we are, fighting.
I don't have to tell you any
more than that, do I?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Sorry, <Kongman>.
I got carried away...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Eh, don't mention it. You're
from Fitzgald too, after all.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now that you mention it, I wasn't
even thinking of Lienea...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, come on.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's not even that I forgot, I know
I should probably worry, but...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I dunno... I just
get the feeling...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah well, it's fine.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
We need to find a way
up there, right?
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
We have to defeat <Miktran> and
get the Eye of Atamoni back.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
But it's only for now!
We'll never give up!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
No matter how many years it
takes, no matter how hard it
is, we will get there!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Our roots are planted on this
earth! You'll never get rid of
them!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm gonna make you pay for
this! I'll make sure of it!
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Sorry, <Dymlos>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Maybe it's because I'm dumb,
but I'm not very obedient.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Whenever I hear something
is impossible, I can never 
back down.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Pretty stupid, huh?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
No.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>

[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Indeed.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Mm-hm.

Yeah, that's
what I say.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Everyone...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see, I get it now.
Why I didn't think
of Lienea...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's because this isn't just
affecting Lienea. We're all
in this together.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I... want to protect it.
I want to protect this
world.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>, tell me what
you really think.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Not as a soldier,
but as yourself.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You may look like a sword, but you're
still a person, just like us, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What would you want to
do in this situation?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>I shouldn't have to say it. 
Of course I want to do something!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>The land we struggled to reclaim
a thousand years ago cannot be
taken from us so easily!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
If that's the case...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character
parameters that can be set. 
The specific method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, press <Square_ani> to 
change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen will be
[Titles]. Press <Triangle_ani> to pick from
all acquired titles.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Titles serve two purposes:
The first is to [affect dialogue 
when talking to NPCs].
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Set a title to have certain NPCs interested
while passing them. When talking with NPCs
multiple times you may get different responses.
Change the title and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to certain NPCs, a [?] will 
appear over the character's head. If this 
happens, set a title that seems to be related
to the dialogue, and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose for titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
