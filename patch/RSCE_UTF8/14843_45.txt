[ENDBLOCK]
It has been ages since last a
human has felt my presence.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
A talking monster!?
[ENDBLOCK]
I have been long known by the people
of Aquaveil as the god that watches
over the dawn and the dusk.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Woaah, that's so cool!
Ah jeez, I'm being rude!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
My name is...
[ENDBLOCK]
I know your name, already. You
needn't waste your breath.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Just like a god!
Very believable!
[ENDBLOCK]
I did not know, however,
that you were so abound
with cunning wit.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Cunning wit...? I don't
get it, but thanks!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Uhm, are you the ghost that
Frantz was talking about?
[ENDBLOCK]
That is certainly possible. Forgive
my rudeness, but I must request
something of you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
A request?
What is it?
[ENDBLOCK]
...I wish...
[ENDBLOCK]
TO DEVOUR YOU!!!
[ENDBLOCK]
It is as I suspected. You hold
great power within you.
[ENDBLOCK]
I will tell you what my
true request is now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Your true request...?
[ENDBLOCK]
Ever since the formation of the land
that covers the sky, the animals that
dwell in Aquaveil have suffered.
[ENDBLOCK]
The smaller, more vulnerable among
them are especially affected. They
grow weaker every passing day.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You don't have to say another
word. Just leave this to me.
[ENDBLOCK]
You speak the truth?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Woah!!
[ENDBLOCK]
Very well. We shall entrust our
world to you, Hero of the Dawn.
[ENDBLOCK]
...Farewell.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
There's something here, I know it.
If only my senses were sharper...
