<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
Impossible...! How...
could I...!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
We won...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
He sure caused us a
lotta trouble. Guess
it's over now, though.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>, it's over. There's no
point in resisting any longer!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll be taking <Igtenos>
back now, <Greybum>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
Fool! Don't think you've
won so easily!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Lord <Woodrow>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
As long as I have the
Eye of Atamoni, I am
invincible!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Igtenos>
[ENDBLOCK]
UAAAGGHHH!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
No! He's channeling the Eye's
power directly into <Igtenos>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>His core crystal won't be
able to withstand that!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
This sword overflows with the
Eye of Atamoni's power! I'll smite
you where you stand!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Stop it, <Greybum>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Look out, <Woodrow>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
GH-AAGHHHHH!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>What a fool. Surely he didn't
think that would work.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmph. In the end, he
destroyed himself.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
The glint in the Eye of
Atamoni has subsided.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Whew, I was worried
for a moment there.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Igtenos>, what's wrong?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why aren't you saying
anything? Answer him!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>Wait... What if he is unable to
speak, even if he wishes to?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you saying 
the Swordian 
was damaged?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Igtenos>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, <Igtenos>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>It seems he still has a minimum
amount of functionality, but...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>It appears he's completely lost
the ability to communicate.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>Can he choose <Woodrow>
as his new master?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, he cannot. Not in this state.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is terrible...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
We'd just rescued him
from <Greybum>, too...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is there no way
to repair him?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>It requires special equipment. Unfortunately,
it doesn't exist in this day and age.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Igtenos>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's just be glad we recovered
him. I'm in your debt, Swordians.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
 We were just doing our job.
There is no need to thank us.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Still, the Eye of Atamoni...
That light was incredible.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I felt like it was going
to swallow me whole...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
It was really scary!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Honestly, it's hard to believe this
thing's a lens! It's so bright...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
So he got what he wanted after all.
I'm sure he'll be very happy, <Lion>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
What? What who wanted...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
...I see. You're just
like me, after all.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
You... what are you talking about?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ignorance truly is bliss... For those
who don't realize... They are but 
pawns being sacrificed...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>! Hey!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Tch, he's gone.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
What are you going to do
with the Eye of Atamoni?
Take it back to Seinegald?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...That's what our mission was.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll use the Draconis <Greybum>
stole to transport it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I should come with you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
We can't just leave the Eye
of Atamoni to Seinegald.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>? What's wrong?
You look troubled.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey. Maybe we should destroy
the Eye of Atamoni, instead.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
What!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Because of it, so many
people have suffered...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Maybe it'd be better
if it was gone?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
 <Stahn>... I know how you
feel, but that's impossible.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why not?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>If we could destroy it, we would
have done so a thousand years ago.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>Even we could not do it. That's
why we took great pains to hide it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
That can't be...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You never know unless you try!
Maybe things are different than
they were a thousand years ago!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll help you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>...
Thank you!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
The Eye of Atamoni has merely
provoked tensions between our
nations.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
As the king of this country, I
will carry out its destruction.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I was actually thinking
the same thing, <Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Bishop <Ayles> may become
angry with me, but I think 
this is the right choice.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll do my best to assist you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>I don't think she's going
to listen to me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
It pains me to think I won't
get any money for a lens
this big, but...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't want some idiot to
misuse it again, either.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>... Are you serious?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah. I've made up my mind. I'll
do what it takes to destroy it!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
...All right. I won't stop you, then.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What about you, <Lion>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
You've forgotten what our
mission was, haven't you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you think I would allow you to
go against the <King>'s orders?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
But, <Lion>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmph. If we're going to do
this, let's get on with it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll help you, too!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's smash it into
a million pieces!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Damn it... Not even a scratch.
How hard can this thing be?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
As I thought, it's no good.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Give up now. There's no
point in trying anymore.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Damn it...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Welp, we have no choice.
Let's take it to Seinegald.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
We've done all we can. The guys
in charge'll handle the rest.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Right, <Woodrow>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes. You have my word.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
So how about we just leave
it at that? We've done what
we set out to do.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah... You're right! Let's
go back to Seinegald with
our heads held high!

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character
parameters that can be set. 
The specific method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, press <Square_ani> to 
change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen will be
[Titles]. Press <Triangle_ani> to pick from
all acquired titles.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Titles serve two purposes:
The first is to [affect dialogue 
when talking to NPCs].
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Set a title to have certain NPCs interested
while passing them. When talking with NPCs
multiple times you may get different responses.
Change the title and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to certain NPCs, a [?] will 
appear over the character's head. If this 
happens, set a title that seems to be related
to the dialogue, and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose for titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>[Rock Rally] is a game in which
