Yo, it's been a while!
How was Seinegald?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I think you may have mistaken
me for someone else.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Come on, stop jerking my chain. I
want to hear about your travels.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
You really aren't
him, are you?
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
Sorry about that...

[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's all right. No harm, no foul.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do I really look that similar
to this gentleman you know?
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, you could be twins.
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
If anyone who knew him saw
you, they would have quite
the reaction.
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
Although last time I saw him, he
sure left town in quite a rush...
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
If you want to know more about
him, you should find his friends.
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
I bet they'd mistake you
for him just like I did.

I bet there are heaps of treasure
just lying around his house.

[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt> is only concerned
with getting himself out
of harm's way.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Man
[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt> is the one who spearheaded

Maybe I was wrong,
about that guy...
[ENDBLOCK]
