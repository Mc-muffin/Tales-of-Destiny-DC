（Hey, he's kinda cute!）

You're that injured girl I saw
being carried to the inn.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, yes, that was me!
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Man
[ENDBLOCK]
You reminded me of my sister,
so I couldn't help but worry
about you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see... Thank you
for your concern.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Man
[ENDBLOCK]
You're that injured girl I saw
being carried to the inn.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, yes, that was me!
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Man
[ENDBLOCK]
You're better... That's
a huge relief...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
N-No way...!
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Man
[ENDBLOCK]
The truth is... I...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Y-Yes?
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Ever since I saw
you that day...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
A-Ah, no... I couldn't! What
about Lord <Woodrow>...?
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Man
[ENDBLOCK]
He doesn't need
to know...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, please don't
tease me...!
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Uh, are you okay? You spaced
out for a moment.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you still hurt?
Do you need help!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
NONONONONONONONO!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
I-I'll be OK! My beauty's
also a curse, that's all!
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Women probably shouldn't go
into a stranger's house alone...
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Man
[ENDBLOCK]
From what I've heard, it seems 
the capital has been overrun 
by rebels.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I was walking through Tilso
forest when I suddenly felt
sleepy.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Man
[ENDBLOCK]
It would've been bad if
I had fallen asleep. Be
careful out there!
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Apparently the rebel's leader,
<Greybum>, had no connection
to this country at all...
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Man
[ENDBLOCK]
The shadows in the sky seem to be
expanding... Is it my imagination?
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Man
[ENDBLOCK]
The sky is gone... Talk
about ominous.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Man
[ENDBLOCK]
If we're gonna do something
about this, we'll need everyone
in the world to work together.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character
parameters that can be set. 
The specific method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, press <Square_ani> to 
change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen will be
[Titles]. Press <Triangle_ani> to pick from
all acquired titles.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Titles serve two purposes:
The first is to [affect dialogue 
when talking to NPCs].
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Set a title to have certain NPCs interested
while passing them. When talking with NPCs
multiple times you may get different responses.
Change the title and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to certain NPCs, a [?] will 
appear over the character's head. If this 
happens, set a title that seems to be related
to the dialogue, and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose for titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
