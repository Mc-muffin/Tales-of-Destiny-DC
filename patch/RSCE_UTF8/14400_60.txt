Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, you are a young man
of Lienea. When you are tired,
don't hesitate to come back.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
It's been a while since you came
home. Why don't you rest a while?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah. I will.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
EEEEEK!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's wrong, <Lilith>!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
There was someone peeking
through the window!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What!? Did you
see their face!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
No... I didn't get a very
good look at them.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Gotcha. I'll go see if I can
find any suspicious people.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay, I brought all the suspicious
people around the house that I saw.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Good work, big bro!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now, confess!
Who was it!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right! Confess immediately!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're under suspicion
too, you know!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
I-I am!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I've got nothing to do with this.
Besides, it was <Bacchus>, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
It wasn't me!
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
I have no idea either, but...
It was probably this guy.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
It wasn't MEEE!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Nah, it wasn't <Bacchus>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ahh, <Stahn>!
You understand!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is that true, big bro?
Well if that's the case...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Still, the culprit
is in here!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
What...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you serious!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
What!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I-It wasn't me though...
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay, who the heck peeked
into the bathroom then?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
Peeked into the...
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Man
[ENDBLOCK]
...Bathroom?
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
H-Huh!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
So, you show your
true colors!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
True colors...?
So it was this kid?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right, this kid's the
perpetrator in the Great
Bathroom Peeper Mystery!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
When I was gathering everyone
up, I didn't dare explain my
reasons for doing so!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Upon seeing <Lilith> angry,
these two reflexively denied
any wrongdoing at all.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
B-But...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
They just knew that <Lilith>
being angry was really bad.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now, give it up already!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is this true?
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
...Yes. I'm the one who peeked
into your bathroom window...
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
You've got a real cool big
brother. What's your name?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
My name is <Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll be sure to remember that
name well! My name is...
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Just what the heck are
you doing, you idiot!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
What was that about?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, anyway, that was really
cool of you, <Stahn>!
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
I was real surprised there.
It's like you turned into a
completely different person.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
N-Nah... I just... was acting
like the main character in a
book I read a long time ago...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're the best, big bro!
[ENDBLOCK]
Villager
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh? I'm just passing through. The
bathroom's none of my concern.
[ENDBLOCK]
Villager
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, you're not gonna be home?
...This is my chance!
[ENDBLOCK]
Villager
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, you're not gonna be home?
...This is my chance!
[ENDBLOCK]
Villager
[ENDBLOCK]
Yo, there's been some weird people
hanging around here lately!
[ENDBLOCK]
Villager
[ENDBLOCK]
Gah, you caught me! Uh, I mean... Oh
no! I'm lost, where am I? Who am I!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Villager
[ENDBLOCK]
Wait a second, this ain't
your house! What are you
even doing here, anyway?
[ENDBLOCK]
Villager
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't care about no Aeth'er War.
I have my own battles to deal with.
[ENDBLOCK]
Villager
[ENDBLOCK]
Eh? What battles do I mean?
...That, I cannot say!
[ENDBLOCK]
Villager
[ENDBLOCK]
Every day is another climactic
battle in my life!

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character
parameters that can be set. 
The specific method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, press <Square_ani> to 
change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen will be
[Titles]. Press <Triangle_ani> to pick from
all acquired titles.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Titles serve two purposes:
The first is to [affect dialogue 
when talking to NPCs].
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Set a title to have certain NPCs interested
while passing them. When talking with NPCs
multiple times you may get different responses.
Change the title and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to certain NPCs, a [?] will 
appear over the character's head. If this 
happens, set a title that seems to be related
to the dialogue, and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose for titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
