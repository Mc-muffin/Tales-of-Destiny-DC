<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Looks like he isn't here...
[ENDBLOCK]
<IGNORE>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I should look around.
You two stay here.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wait, I'll go with you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
In that case, I'll leave the
house to you, <Woodrow>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well then, what to do?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Please, excuse this intrusion.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn> and <Mary> left just a
moment ago to search for you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
Must have just missed one another.
I expect they'll be back shortly.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
May I ask you something?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I heard you asked <Mary>
to go on this journey.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Given the danger, why...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
Right...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
We faced much hardship
when we were young...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
I wanted <Mary> to live
her life freely.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
I couldn't help it, I suppose.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, you came home, huh?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes. Seems we just
missed each other.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
I assume you'll be setting off?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Sorry, <Dalis>. I'm not
a very good wife.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
What are you on about,
<Mary>? You're incredible!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
Besides, I'm heading
out soon, myself.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you, <Dalis>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
The color of your complexion is
worrisome... I suppose that's to
be expected after everything.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
How about taking a short rest?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, you're probably right.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
We really needed that rest.
Thank you, <Dalis>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
O-Of course.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh yeah. You called out
<Mary>'s name in your sleep.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
I-Is that so? I don't
remember doing so...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You must have been having
quite the dream. Well, we
should probably get going.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
Y-Yeah. Take care.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
We will.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
...I still feel exhausted.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
If it isn't <Lion>! You look
like you're doing well.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmph. You seem like
you're living well.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I am. I have you to thank.
After all, you let me go.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
My life has become very peaceful
living here with <Dalis>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Speaking of <Dalis>,
where is he now?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
He recently set out to the
northern guard tower.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
He's undergoing medical treatment
at the Frostheim hot springs.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Little by little his condition
is improving.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Good. That's the most
important thing.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
You've come all this way. You
should stay for dinner tonight!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I make one mean Beast
Meat Poelee, you know!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Of course, you are welcome to
stay the night if it gets late.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
There's no need. I won't
be staying long.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why is that?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I have a job to do. I don't
have time for a long visit.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see... That's a shame.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now, I must be off.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't be a stranger.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sure <Dalis> would love
to host you soon.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_005><center>You find a love letter in the
gap between the books.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_005>Dear Mr. <Dalis>,
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
			Your secret admirer
[ENDBLOCK]
<Leader>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's pretend we didn't see this.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_005>Gently, you put the love
letter back in its place.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_005>There are books filled with
memories of <Dalis> and <Mary>.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_005>The snow white grass is dying.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>, take care of yourself.
Make sure you come back.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey guys. Has <Mary>
been helpful?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm feeling much better. Those
hot springs work wonders.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
Entrust Cyril to me. I'll
keep the people safe.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
I think I'll go to the castle and
discuss strategies with <Darzen>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
We can't afford to have the people
of Cyril continue living in turmoil.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
The dragons seem to have been helpful.
I'm sure <Darzen> will be pleased.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, and the rest of you, take care.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
...<Woodrow>, be sure to come back.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
...And <Mary>. I love you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I will never forget what
you have done for me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I hope that we can be
together again soon.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character
parameters that can be set. 
The specific method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, press <Square_ani> to 
change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen will be
[Titles]. Press <Triangle_ani> to pick from
all acquired titles.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Titles serve two purposes:
The first is to [affect dialogue 
when talking to NPCs].
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Set a title to have certain NPCs interested
while passing them. When talking with NPCs
multiple times you may get different responses.
Change the title and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to certain NPCs, a [?] will 
appear over the character's head. If this 
happens, set a title that seems to be related
to the dialogue, and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose for titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>[Rock Rally] is a game in which

to clear certain objectives.

Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007><x0E><x01><x00><x00><x00>Here are the basic rules.
1: Kicking a rock outside the
	city will start the game.
2: Battles don't affect the clearing
	objective of the Rock Rally game.
3: The rock will return to its original
	location when you enter or leave
	a city or dungeon.
