<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
So did you find out the
truth of the matter?
[ENDBLOCK]
<IGNORE>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah. I'll let
<Stahn> explain.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
I-I'm counting on you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay. There are a few major
points to the case.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>First off...
This girl talks to cats in a loud voice.
This girl really likes fish.
The existence of a secret passage is unlikely.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>And also...
People who're attacked always have two injuries.
This girl is from Shiden.
This girl is still very young.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
Does that really have
anything to do with the
truth of the case at hand?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...My bad. Let me think
about this again.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
There's no need to rush.
Think over it carefully.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
All right. With that in mind,
who's the culprit?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The person who actually
committed the crime...
...was you, <Fayte>!
...was you, <Johnny>!
...was that soldier there!
...was you, little girl!
...was you, <Rutee>!
...was the ghost of <Tiberius>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
WHAT!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey <Stahn>, you joking
around or what?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you have anything
to base that on!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you serious!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're saying I'm the culprit
even though I've been with you
literally the entire time?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...not just saying it...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Come on, <Stahn>. We're
counting on you, here.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
M-Me!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
That can't be!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why would he attack
his comrade?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Aha...hahah...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
WHAT!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is this true!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, <Stahn>. Are you actually
tryin' to make me mad?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...My bad.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
WHAT!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey <Stahn>, you joking
around or what?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...I was thinking of someone
who would have had a grudge.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is no time
for jokes!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
WHAT!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you have anything
to base that on!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You see, this girl...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Has a twin!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Therefore, the other of
the two must still be in
this house somewhere!
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
How did you know!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I figured that it was possible there
were two culprits since the victims
always had two injuries on them.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Furthermore, based on the testimony
that ruled out the use of a secret
passage, I concluded that we must
be dealing with twins.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see. What about the testimony
about her talking to a cat?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
As for that, while one of them
committed the crime, the other
made a scene talking to the cat.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
This gave them
the perfect alibi.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's pretty funny. So then
what about the two injuries
each victim had?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Simply put, because there were two of
them, the one doing the crime inflicted
two injuries to represent that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
But why, though? Why would
these two small kids attack
our soldiers like this?
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
That's...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
By chance are you from
the House of Terazzi?
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
We are. Even though we're distant
relatives, we suffered greatly
from Lord <Tiberius>' death.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
So much that you
would go this far?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
Could it be that we're the
ones who made criminals
out of these children?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>, what will happen
to them now?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well... luckily, the soldier's injuries
weren't very severe at all.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
Considering they're children, as
well as their circumstances...
We'll let them off easy this time.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't do anything bad from
here on out. Got it?
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes. We apologize.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes. We apologize.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
At any rate, that
was awesome!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Aw, shucks, it was nothing.
A book I read once had the
same trick in it...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Even so, that was impressive.
You have my gratitude, <Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_005>There's nothing inside.

[ENDBLOCK]
You're...! ...No,
never mind.
