However, it is only in the midst

the value of freedom, Nyan!

Did you find a natural hot spring?
It's a mixed bathing area.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, there are only old people
here. It's not my place to say.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
You've found a giant
snowman. It's too big to
be made by human hands.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
And it's too well shaped to
be a natural creation.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
No way, a monster!
It can't be ...can it?
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Have you found the candle
tree? The lights shining in
the snow-clear air.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
It's very moody.
...What? It's a dead language?
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Well then, let me share with
you an interesting story...
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Frostheim is famous for its hot
springs, but there is also a secluded
hot spring that can cure all kinds of
diseases in a remote place.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Of course, you'll have to find
it yourself. It is, after all, a
hidden hot spring.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
It is said that very large chunks
of snow appear overnight in the
area of Frostheim.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
What's a snowball?
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
The last time I saw a peddler,
the number of travelers in the
city had declined due to the
event two years ago.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
He said he was going to go make
some money since he had more.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Young people seem to be looking for
the hottest spots near the city.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
It looks like someone's playing
a prank, but the people in town
seem to be very grateful.
