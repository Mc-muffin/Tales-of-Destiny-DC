Are you from Calvalese?
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Calvalese?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You see...
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm?
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Is this about father?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Father?
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Father lived in a very hot
place when he was a child.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
And where is your father now?
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Father died in the last war.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...I'm sorry.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't be. Seeing someone looking
for him brings me joy.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Here, I'd like you to have this.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
That reminds me, father always
used to say there was someone
he wanted to meet in Neustadt.

...Just as I thought,
they do look similar...
[ENDBLOCK]
Adventurer
[ENDBLOCK]
...What do you mean...?
[ENDBLOCK]
Adventurer
[ENDBLOCK]
You look the part, are
you adventurers too?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, yes.
[ENDBLOCK]
Adventurer
[ENDBLOCK]
If that's the case, would
you have a look at this?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
What is this?
[ENDBLOCK]
Adventurer
[ENDBLOCK]
An adventurer friend of mine
sent me this picture.
[ENDBLOCK]
Adventurer
[ENDBLOCK]
Somehow, other adventurer friends
of mine have been sending me photos
that look exactly like this one.
[ENDBLOCK]
Adventurer
[ENDBLOCK]
If there is any meaning to these
pictures, it's totally beyond me.
[ENDBLOCK]
Adventurer
[ENDBLOCK]
If you have time, would you go
look around for this place?
[ENDBLOCK]
Adventurer
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't know where it could be, so
use this picture as a reference.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, sure.
[ENDBLOCK]
Adventurer
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll be here for a little while
longer, should you need to
see the picture again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Adventurer
[ENDBLOCK]
One last thing. If you find anything
in this place, tell me. I'll make it
worth your while.
[ENDBLOCK]
Adventurer
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll also be sure to tell my friends
about you. They're the ones who
sent me these photographs.
[ENDBLOCK]
Adventurer
[ENDBLOCK]
The three of them are currently in
Cyril, Straylize Temple, and Shiden.
[ENDBLOCK]
Adventurer
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, buddy. Are
you <Stahn>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh, yes...
[ENDBLOCK]
Adventurer
[ENDBLOCK]
Recently, another adventurer asked
you to look at a photograph, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
Adventurer
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm the friend that sent
him the photograph.
[ENDBLOCK]
Adventurer
[ENDBLOCK]
If you want to see the picture
again, just come and see me.
[ENDBLOCK]
Adventurer
[ENDBLOCK]
Look at the picture again?
Yes
No
[ENDBLOCK]
Adventurer
[ENDBLOCK]
I see, so that's
what happened.
[ENDBLOCK]
Adventurer
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Adventurer
[ENDBLOCK]
Here's your reward.
Please take it.
[ENDBLOCK]
Adventurer
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll take my leave
now. See you.
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll refer you to my friends, the
ones who took the pictures.
[ENDBLOCK]
They are in Cyril, Straylize
Temple, and Shiden.
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll refer you to my friends, the

How am I supposed to rest when all
I can think about is how Belcrant
may strike at any moment?
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
We will do what we can here.
Please, save the world!
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
We won the fight because Lord
<Greybum> was on our side.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
People were praising Lord
<Greybum> before, but now
they're all badmouthing him.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
In the end, the grown-ups are
just putting all the blame on
Lord <Greybum>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
The sky is looking weird.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
The sky flashed and made a
loud sound out of nowhere.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
What will we do if the
whole sky is blocked?
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
We sent all our lens to Heidelberg.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
When did we start being
friendly to outsiders?
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
If everybody joins forces together,
we will definitely win.

Titles are one of the character
parameters that can be set. 
The specific method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, press <Square_ani> to 
change the character status.

<TAG_007>At the top of this screen will be
[Titles]. Press <Triangle_ani> to pick from
all acquired titles.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Titles serve two purposes:
The first is to [affect dialogue 
when talking to NPCs].
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Set a title to have certain NPCs interested
while passing them. When talking with NPCs
multiple times you may get different responses.
Change the title and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to certain NPCs, a [?] will 
appear over the character's head. If this 
happens, set a title that seems to be related
to the dialogue, and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose for titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
