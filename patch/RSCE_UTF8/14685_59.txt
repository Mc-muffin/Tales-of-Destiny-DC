Trash that we're about

<center>Stop calling it trash. This mountain
could be a treasure trove of Berselium.

Let's all split up and
search the area.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I-I'll do my best...
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
You don't look so good, <Philia>.
Is this too much for you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Not at all...
I'm fine...

You are clearly unwell.

Don't push yourself
too hard...

Berselium...
A blue metal...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I found a pretty rock.
Isn't it great?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's yellow. What could
we possibly need it for?

Lord <Woodrow>, I'm filthy

Yeah, yeah. We'll clean up later.
For now, can you just search 
for that Berselium?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>

Phooey!

<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
It looks like <Kongman> got

trash.

O-Oh? What did I just...?

the city if you want.

<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I would never place such
a burden on you all!

Do you really think you
can still do anything?

[ENDBLOCK]
We do.

If we all work together,
we can definitely bring
the sky back.
[ENDBLOCK]
Are us Calvalesians
included in that?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Of course you're included. We
all live in the same world.
[ENDBLOCK]
There's an extensive system of
caves within. You might find
what you're looking for inside.
[ENDBLOCK]
But it won't be easy. There's 
toxic fumes everywhere.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Toxic fumes...?
[ENDBLOCK]
Take these neutralizers. You'll be
safe from the gas while they're in
effect.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why are you helping us?
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't want you to think that all
people in Calvalese are the same.
[ENDBLOCK]
Some of us want to change the
future with our own hands.
...Myself included.

Thank you...!
