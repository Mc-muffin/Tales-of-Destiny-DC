[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
My dad... He never says
anything nice to me...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Come on, don't cry.
...Cheer up!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Poor kid...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let it go. We've
got work to do.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
But <Lion>...
[ENDBLOCK]
Child
[ENDBLOCK]
You're so mean! You don't
know a thing about-
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Of course I don't.
How would I know?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
You don't understand
your own father, yet
you expect me to?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>, he's just a kid,
you shou-
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, be quiet.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
He's a total stranger to you,
even though he's your father.
[ENDBLOCK]
Child
[ENDBLOCK]
B-But father doesn't...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
If he won't change, then it's up
to you to change your own way
of thinking.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes... That's the
right thing to do...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>...?
[ENDBLOCK]
Child
[ENDBLOCK]
I... I don't understand at all!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, let's go.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I...O-Okay.

[ENDBLOCK]
Well, well, well they call me, Chatty
Old Man. Nice to meet you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
The... Chatty Old Man...?
Well, it's nice to meet you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Chatty Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmmm. The opportunity to come in
contact with someone for the first
time is a once in a lifetime event,
which must be cherished.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't get it...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
He means, don't mess up your first
impression when you meet someone.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Ohh... I get it!
Thank you!
[ENDBLOCK]
Child
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, it's you!
[ENDBLOCK]
Child
[ENDBLOCK]
I was angry with that girly man
you were with earlier, don't you
remember?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh... Yeah, good times?
[ENDBLOCK]
Child
[ENDBLOCK]
You don't remember do you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, well...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...I'm sorry.
[ENDBLOCK]
Child
[ENDBLOCK]
It's not that big of a deal. For real,
though, where's that girly man?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Uhm...
[ENDBLOCK]
Child
[ENDBLOCK]
I wanted to thank him!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Really?
[ENDBLOCK]
Child
[ENDBLOCK]
I changed my way of thinking like he
said, and my dad is different too!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, do you like this "new" dad?
[ENDBLOCK]
Child
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, and I think it's because
I've grown up a little.
[ENDBLOCK]
Child
[ENDBLOCK]
He can still be a bit pig-headed but
he's now showing me a nicer side.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Our friend isn't here right now,
but I know he would be happy
with what you just told me.
[ENDBLOCK]
Child
[ENDBLOCK]
Really? He doesn't seem like the
kind of person who would be
happy listening to a kid's story.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
This kid has only met <Lion> once
but can see straight into his soul...
[ENDBLOCK]
Child
[ENDBLOCK]
Anyway, if you see that girly
man again, please pass along
my thanks!

[ENDBLOCK]
After we managed to escape,

It was really hard to make it
back to town.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
I heard that Lord <Fayte> of the
Moreau territory was captured.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
The other day I asked <Johnny> to
build a fleet in Shiden as well.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
I heard a strange voice in the sky.
Is it true that this is the work of
Seinegald?
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>! I'm begging you.
Please do something!

[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Keep honing your skills on
the rocks outside of town.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
First, you need to kick a
rock at least 32 times.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's see... you need to kick
it at least 64 times.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's see... you need to kick
it at least 96 times.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's see... you need to kick
it at least 128 times.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Wow! You're doing great! Now
the ultimate challenge, at least
160 times.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmmm. I'm thinking at least 48
more times will do the trick.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Wow, this is Shiden?
The buildings are all
so different.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Welp, should we go look
for the Oberon branch
here, like in Calvalese?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
There isn't one here.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Remember? Aquaveil has a
policy of national isolation.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Incidentally, there's no
Straylize Temple here, 
either.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well then, what 
do we do now?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary> and I will hang around and
try to scout out some information.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You guys lay low 
in this area.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Will you be okay if
it's just you two?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
We'll be better off if it's just us
two. We'll be too conspicuous if
we all try to go together.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>'s not back yet...
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
<Tiberius> carried out the
military suppression of
Moreau?
[ENDBLOCK]
The Moreau port has been blockaded.
What will become of our trade routes?
[ENDBLOCK]
It seems <Tiberius> called in
an outsider as his military
advisor.
[ENDBLOCK]
I've heard about that. 
His name was Grey... 
something.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Shh! Be quiet!
[ENDBLOCK]
There are also rumors
that the third prince is
heading toward Moreau.
[ENDBLOCK]
Isn't he just sightseeing as usual?
That helpless libertine...
[ENDBLOCK]
He used to be a 
sensible person.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>It's possible that we've obtained
the information we wanted.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
So <Greybum> isn't here. 
We should go check out
Moreau.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
But how...? If the ports are
closed, we can't use a ship.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mysterious Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Two men, one woman. You
lot must be the backup.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh?
[ENDBLOCK]
You must go to Moreau at
once. I will send word to 
the Young Prince.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Umm, aren't you mistaking
us for someone else?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Indeed, we are the backup. What's
the best way to get to Moreau?
[ENDBLOCK]
You can use the tidal cave.
There's an entrance to it
to the south of town.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Right, got it.
[ENDBLOCK]
The floor of the cavern is very
brittle. Please be cautious.
[ENDBLOCK]
There are terrible monsters living
there as well. Try not to linger.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're just going to
lie to him like that?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
He's the one who made
such a careless mistake.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
We're back. We heard some things
from the townspeople. It seems
like <Greybum> is in Moreau.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
We know.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well then, apparently Moreau's
under military suppression.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, we heard that too.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
W-Well, do you know about
the Prince? He's in Moreau
right now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, we know.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, <Mary>. I feel like screaming
at the top of my lungs right now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll follow your lead.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
We should head for that tidal cave.
The entrance is south of town.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, yeah, whatever.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Look anywhere there might
be some rope. Leave no 
stone unturned.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Don't dawdle, you two!

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Titles serve two purposes:
The first is to [affect dialogue 
when talking to NPCs].
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Set a title to have certain NPCs interested
while passing them. When talking with NPCs
multiple times you may get different responses.
Change the title and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to certain NPCs, a [?] will 
appear over the character's head. If this 
happens, set a title that seems to be related
to the dialogue, and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose for titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
