<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is that...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...<Lion>!
[ENDBLOCK]
???
[ENDBLOCK]
I didn't expect you
to be so persistent.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
That voice...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
We already know who you
are. Why don't you remove
that hideous disguise?
[ENDBLOCK]
???
[ENDBLOCK]
...You're one brave young lady.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
So you were the mastermind behind
all of this. What vile purpose do you
have for the Eye of Atamoni?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now what? Gonna be the king
of the monsters like <Greybum>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Total control over monsters is
but one of the powers bestowed
by the Eye of Atamoni.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hahahahaha... Did it ever occur
to you he was a pawn all along?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Tempting <Greybum> to steal
the Eye of Atamoni...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Running amuck across the globe...
All according to my grand design!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It can't be...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Once he outlived his usefulness, I
was going to dispose of <Greybum>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
I must thank you for
doing that for me. 
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
We didn't do it for you!
Don't make me laugh!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
That enraged face of yours... It's
just like your dear mother's.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, our time together is up.
I must bid you farewell.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...<Lion>! Stop <Hugo>, please!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're just pretending,
yeah!? You planned this
all along, right, <Lion>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Right?
<Lion>!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>! I knew it...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Go on ahead. I'll hold them here.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>, you...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center><Chaltier>! What's going on!?
Answer me, <Chaltier>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>, I can't believe this.
It's... just a joke, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you have any idea
what you're doing!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, I understand what I'm
doing. Far more than you
ever could, in fact!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hah... Hah...
I... won...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Damn it! Why won't you
just stay down!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>! Hey! Stay with me!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmph... One on one, I
wouldn't have lost...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You idiot...! Why are
you doing this...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Please don't blame Master <Lion>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>He had no choice but to do
this to protect <Marian>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>, now you say something...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Chal! You talk too much!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
You saw her at <Hugo>'s 
  manor, remember?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
The maid who brought
me <Dymlos>! <Lion>, you...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
So they've taken her hostage...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>Still, that doesn't mean you're
doing the right thing.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're still a Swordian Master!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
It doesn't matter
what you say...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't have a shred of regret
for what I've done!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Even if I were reborn a hundred
times over, I would still choose
the same path!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't let you pass!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
This person you've become...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why go this far...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You stupid idiot! Why
are you so stubborn!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're making a mistake! You
hear me, <Lion>!? You're wrong!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Enough! This decision was
mine alone to make.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's where you're wrong!
You're not alone!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why can't you understand that!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, be careful!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Stay back...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why didn't you tell me!?
Why try and do it all by
yourself!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
We're comrades! Friends!
Why...? Why would you 
keep this from me!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I said stay back!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Here you are on your
own! Suffering alone!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why should you suffer all alone? 
Why should you have to bear this
burden all by yourself!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Friends are supposed to
help each other through
hard times!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
How could you not know that!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Even after all this...
You still consider me
your friend...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Of course!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...<Lion>, it's not too late.
You can still come with 
us.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
What...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
We're going to make things right.
We're going to reclaim the Eye of
Atamoni, and rescue <Marian>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
You...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Seriously... You're a
real piece of work...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>! You understand me, right...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>... I...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
First, let's shake hands
to make up! C'mon!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
An earthquake? In
a place like this?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
That damn <Hugo>...!
He's already begun!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Begun...? Are you saying that <Hugo>
is causing this earthquake?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Even though you're still here!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's the type of
person <Hugo> is...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>, go see if the
elevator is safe.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, sir!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's no good! The ceiling collapsed!
We can't get back to the elevator!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
What're we gonna do!? We're
gonna be buried alive!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's that sound...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>Seems the cave is collapsing, and
the seawater is flowing in.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
No...! This place will be
completely submerged!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...There's a way out.
Look over there.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's an emergency lift.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't believe how lucky we are!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Everyone, hurry up and get in.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You too, <Lion>. Come on!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't come with you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Someone has to pull this
lever for the lift to move.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>, what are you saying?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>. There's something I
need to tell you. Something
you deserve to know.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>'s deceased wife...Her
name was Chris Katrea.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Chris was... also my mother.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wh-What...!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
As much as I hate to admit it,
the same blood flows through 
our veins.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're... lying...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>, just get over
here! We'll talk later!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
And you, <Stahn>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
You call me your friend, but I don't
remember ever agreeing to that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't stand laid-back, careless,
overly-friendly people like you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
And that's why... I leave
the rest to you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Oberon's Hidden Factory
[ENDBLOCK]
Oberon's Hidden Factory
[ENDBLOCK]
???
[ENDBLOCK]
With the Eye of Atamoni
returned, the world can
once again be at "peace."
[ENDBLOCK]
???
[ENDBLOCK]
A blessing should be offered...
[ENDBLOCK]
???
[ENDBLOCK]
However, they must realize that
this peace is a false one.
[ENDBLOCK]
???
[ENDBLOCK]
In order for this world to know true
peace, everything must change.
[ENDBLOCK]
???
[ENDBLOCK]
The time has come. Entrust unto me
everything, including your lives.
[ENDBLOCK]
???
[ENDBLOCK]
I have been preparing for
this moment all my life...
[ENDBLOCK]
???
[ENDBLOCK]
I gladly place my life in your hands.
[ENDBLOCK]
???
[ENDBLOCK]
As you wish.
[ENDBLOCK]
???
[ENDBLOCK]
I expect great things from you all.
We will finally realize our ideals...

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character
parameters that can be set. 
The specific method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, press <Square_ani> to 
change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen will be
[Titles]. Press <Triangle_ani> to pick from
all acquired titles.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Titles serve two purposes:
The first is to [affect dialogue 
when talking to NPCs].
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Set a title to have certain NPCs interested
while passing them. When talking with NPCs
multiple times you may get different responses.
Change the title and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to certain NPCs, a [?] will 
appear over the character's head. If this 
happens, set a title that seems to be related
to the dialogue, and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose for titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
