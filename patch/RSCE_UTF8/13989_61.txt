Me?

<TAG_007>What do you want?
I have no business with children.
[ENDBLOCK]

What kind of food
do you usually eat?

<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Uh...
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
What kinda answer
was that? "Uhhh"!
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Don't be like that. Listen!
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Yesterday, when I didn't eat
my veggies, my mom got mad!
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
She was all, "You won't 
grow if you don't eat 
your veggies."
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
So I have a question for you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Is there any food 
that you don't like?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm not particularly picky, but...
I really don't like sweets.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, reaaally~?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, really. You 
don't believe me?
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
I saw you staring at the Softy
Kreem stand, you know.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I was... staring in
disgust, that's all!
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmmm... So basically, 
I can grow big if I eat
lots of sweets!

would you like?

Ah, never mind. I don't
want anything.

Softy Kreem Stand
[ENDBLOCK]
Hm? I swear I've heard that
one before, somewhere.
[ENDBLOCK]
Softy Kreem Stand
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh yeah! It was just before the
city was attacked by monsters.
[ENDBLOCK]
Softy Kreem Stand
[ENDBLOCK]
He was kinda small, bit
of a pretty-boy, too.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...?
[ENDBLOCK]
Softy Kreem Stand
[ENDBLOCK]
He said he didn't want anything,
but he kept staring at my stand.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
That sounds like...!
[ENDBLOCK]
Softy Kreem Stand
[ENDBLOCK]
Guess some guys just think
it's unmanly to like sweets.

Yeah, that definitely sounds

That attack the other day really
did a number on my stand.

that, though!

Welcome!
It's extra kreemy today!
[ENDBLOCK]
Softy Kreem Stand

Sales haven't been
good lately.
[ENDBLOCK]
Softy Kreem Stand

Guess this ain't the time
to be selling Softy Kreem.

Softy Kreem Stand

Would you like to try

Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
I lost all my Gald in the arena.
I can't even buy lunch, now!
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll have to rely on what I
can catch. Oh! Did I get
a bite!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
I thought I had a fish...
Guess it was just my
imagination.
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, thank goodness this place is
back up and running so quickly.
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
If I were to fish in the harbor,
the fishermen would give me 
the evil eye.
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
Did you guys hear a voice
from somewhere? It really
startled me.
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
Fishing's pretty dangerous
too. You never know when
a monster'll attack.
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
You guys are collecting lens?
What are you going to use 
them for?
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
There's a very nice woman downtown.
I wonder if I can get close to her.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I hope that gal downtown wasn't
injured in the commotion...
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
That girl saw me with my
sister the other day...
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I hope she doesn't
get the wrong idea.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder how she's feeling right
now. I want to go check on her,
but... hmmm.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I heard going downtown
is dangerous nowadays.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm... What should I do?
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
I wish they'd get rid of the arena.
I hate dealing with those hoodlums.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
It was this square
that suffered the 
most damage.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
However, it's fortunate the damage
was concentrated. It was easier to
fix, that way.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Ms. <Ilene> is too lenient with
people from downtown. I'd give
them a piece of my mind.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
As long as Neustadt is safe,
I don't care about the rest.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
This is truly an
awful situation.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you sure you just want lens?
I can provide money too, you know.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
So please, please, please!
Please help us!
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Stop staring at me.
Leave me alone!
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
I have my Softy Kreem Shop
back. I'm so happy!
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
I had to buy another Softy Kreem
because it melted after all of the
excitement.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
There are more kids from downtown
hanging around here these days.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
I feel like Neustadt's the only
place that gets attacked!
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
I wanna ask Papa to move
us somewhere brighter.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Papa says I should get along
with downtown kids. Why?
[ENDBLOCK]
Poor Child
[ENDBLOCK]
...
[ENDBLOCK]
Poor Child
[ENDBLOCK]
I hope that nice
lady is okay...
[ENDBLOCK]
Poor Child
[ENDBLOCK]

Poor Child

I want to go to a new world,

[ENDBLOCK]
Poor Child

[ENDBLOCK]

I hope you find them

Excuse me, can I

[ENDBLOCK]
Softy Kreem Stand
[ENDBLOCK]
Which flavors would
you like?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Woah, there's a lot
to pick from. Hmm, 
which one...
[ENDBLOCK]
???
[ENDBLOCK]
Mmmh, which should I pick?
[ENDBLOCK]
???
[ENDBLOCK]
The standard mocha flavor, or the
limited cherry? Which one should I
choose...? Oh dear...
[ENDBLOCK]
???
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, which one
would you pick?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Eh? Me?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Me? I'd definitely
go with vanilla.
[ENDBLOCK]
???
[ENDBLOCK]
Why vanilla? You heard me
say mocha or cherry, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
If you can't decide between two
options, then your answer is a
third option... right?
[ENDBLOCK]
???
[ENDBLOCK]
I see. I hadn't
thought of that...
[ENDBLOCK]
???
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay, then I'll take
one vanilla, please!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, me too.
Five vanilla!
[ENDBLOCK]
Sorry for the wait.
Here's five vanillas.
[ENDBLOCK]
???
[ENDBLOCK]
Mmm, delicious! The vanilla flavor
here really is the best!
[ENDBLOCK]
???
[ENDBLOCK]
Just one visit to this place and 
nowhere else can compare!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, do you want me
to help carry them?
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Nah, I'm good.

Oh my, these are your

Hmm...? Those children...
[ENDBLOCK]
???
[ENDBLOCK]
Yoohoo~ Would you 
like some, too?
[ENDBLOCK]
???
[ENDBLOCK]
Sir, I'd like one for these children
here, if you please. All of them.
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you sure that's all right, miss?
[ENDBLOCK]
???
[ENDBLOCK]
Of course. It's better to eat
with everyone, after all.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Here you go, everyone!
Softy Kreem, my treat!

Hey now, don't push! There's

[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah.
[ENDBLOCK]

Hah! Do you think so?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>

We should go back soon. The

[ENDBLOCK]
Don't think you can buy everything
with money, <Ilene> <Rembrandt>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
I betcha'd try to buy everyone
in Fitzgald's souls if you could!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene> <Rembrandt>? <Stahn>,
that name is definitely...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've explained the Oberon
Corporation's intentions to
you many times already.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
We're investing our funds with
the hopes of developing Fitzgald.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hah! You're just tryin' to turn a
profit! The people who've lived
here from the start are still poor!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's... but... we're...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmph. What do you people from
Seinegald know about Fitzgald?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Outsiders have no business here.
Hurry up and get lost already!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey... You can't say that!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You shouldn't judge
someone because of
where they're from!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's it to you, kid? You
tryin' to preach to me?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>... maybe we

[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
But...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Y-You...! You're...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, truly, my eyes are blessed
to gaze upon you, fair maiden...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Who, m-me?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
My heart! It races!
You're exactly my
type!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Would you care to share an
energy drink? Or we could
do squats together!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>Well, well. Some pickup

scaring <Philia>!
[ENDBLOCK]

Butt out, kid! Who's she to ya?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia> is my friend!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
It seems that you and I
are destined to battle!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
I challenge you to a duel!
I'll see you at my arena!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why do we have to duel!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center><Stahn>, you don't have to play along.
We don't have time for games.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Have you lost your nerve,
boy? Is that sword hanging
at your waist too dull?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
What did you say, you insolent-!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
If you're a real man, you'll duel me!
IF you're a real man, that is!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
All right... If it means that
much to you, I'll do it!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>I'll make you regret insulting me.
<Stahn>, let's give him hell!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>, please be sure to
watch. Afterwards, we will
toast my victory!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center><Dymlos>... If you won't stop him,
what are we going to do?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ugh... but...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do whatever you like.
It doesn't bother me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sorry, <Stahn>.
Because of me,
you...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's not really your fault, <Philia>.
It was a decision I made myself.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
So, where is the
arena, anyway?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
If you go up the main street
in town to the north, there's
an entrance at the end.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you. I'll head
there now.
[ENDBLOCK]
