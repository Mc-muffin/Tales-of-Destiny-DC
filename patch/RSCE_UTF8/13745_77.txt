Meat Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
Of the Seven Generals,
<Dryden> is the one the
soldiers fear the most.
[ENDBLOCK]
Meat Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
However, that's because he puts
his country and its people first.
[ENDBLOCK]
Meat Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
He's more popular with the people
of Darilsheid than you might think.
[ENDBLOCK]
???
[ENDBLOCK]
Hm? Aren't you...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Have we met before?
[ENDBLOCK]
???
[ENDBLOCK]
No, we've never spoken before.
Though, I've certainly heard of
you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Isard>
[ENDBLOCK]
I am one of the Seven Generals,
<Isard> of the Dawn Sky.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm <Stahn> Aileron.
It's nice to meet
you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What are you up to
here, General <Isard>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Isard>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm just admiring
the ocean view...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm not bothering you, am I?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Isard>
[ENDBLOCK]
Not at all! I was just looking
for someone to chat with.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Um... sure. I can
talk, if you'd like.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Isard>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're just as they say.
Pure and to the point.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hehe, thank you very much.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Isard>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let me tell you something. I'm
not actually from Seinegald.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Really!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
If people knew that, wouldn't you be
expelled from the Seven Generals!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Isard>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hahaha! Fear not. It's
well known already.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Isard>
[ENDBLOCK]
Years ago, my homeland was ravaged
by a civil war. During that time, I was
exiled here.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Isard>
[ENDBLOCK]
And yet, this country accepted
me with open arms.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
But... surely you must worry.
About your homeland, I mean.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Isard>
[ENDBLOCK]
I left a lot behind me,
then. ...It's likely they
hate me, now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hate...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Isard>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, I've rambled enough.
Take care, <Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
General <Isard>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Isard>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, looks like
you're all right.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Isard>
[ENDBLOCK]
Y-You! It's you...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's wrong?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you know <Johnny>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Isard>
[ENDBLOCK]
I knew it, you're
Lord <Johnny>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you... from Aquaveil?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Isard>
[ENDBLOCK]
...I am.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is General <Isard>. He's
one of the Seven Generals.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, isn't that something!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Isard>
[ENDBLOCK]
I...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Isard>
[ENDBLOCK]
Lord <Johnny>, please pass
judgement on me!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Woah, hey now. What's this
all of a sudden? Why would
I need to judge you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
He's right, General <Isard>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Isard>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm... I'm the reason that
Lord Gino is dead...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
...<Fayte>'s father, eh?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
All right, explain yourself.
Then I'll pass judgement.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, this is between us.
Please don't interfere.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Isard>
[ENDBLOCK]
When <Tiberius> took the throne, Lord
Gino... the country itself... I abandoned
them both and fled here!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Isard>
[ENDBLOCK]
My regret for fleeing has
haunted me to this day.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Isard>
[ENDBLOCK]
I wandered this land for some
time, and the only news I had
of home was...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Isard>
[ENDBLOCK]
...was that Lord
Gino was dead...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Isard>
[ENDBLOCK]
If only I hadn't fled...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Isard>
[ENDBLOCK]
If only I stayed by
Lord Gino's side...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Isard>
[ENDBLOCK]
Maybe things would
have been different!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, survivor's guilt, eh?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
If you had stayed, though, you
likely would have perished, too.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
No one can truly know 
"what if," you know?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Isard>
[ENDBLOCK]
But Lord <Johnny>! Lord <Fayte>
should know about my-
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't be so vain.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Of all the soldiers in the army,
do you really think <Fayte> would
remember you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
But as long as we're talking
about your punishment...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
I hereby sentence you to protect this
land with your life as a member of its
Seven Generals.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
And also, come visit home
once in a while. That is all.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Isard>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you... I swear to serve
my sentence even if it costs
me my life!
[ENDBLOCK]
Fish Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, you fellas there...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
What is it?
[ENDBLOCK]
Fish Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
Sorry. It's just that your
eyes are like mine.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Our eyes are like yours...?
[ENDBLOCK]
Fish Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
The eyes of one who has
lost someone important.
[ENDBLOCK]
Fish Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
You see, a good friend of
mine lost his life at sea.
[ENDBLOCK]
Fish Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't even wanna look at the
ocean. And yet, I fear if I leave
the sea behind I'll forget about
him completely.
[ENDBLOCK]
Fish Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
If you've lost someone, too,
you may wish to revisit the
place where it happened.
[ENDBLOCK]
Fish Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sure that would make
them happy, as well...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Where we lost <Lion>, huh...
[ENDBLOCK]
Fish Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
Heh, I just want a life with
no sadness or strife.

[ENDBLOCK]

The Oberon Corporation IS evil!

[ENDBLOCK]
The people here are giving me such

<Marian> is wasting her time.
No one's coming back there...
[ENDBLOCK]
Maid
[ENDBLOCK]
Even if nobody comes back, it's
our job to keep the place tidy.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
...Actually, that's just what <Marian>

Straylize Temple is amazing.
It's remarkable how pious the
people in this country are.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sailor

There's one in my hometown too,
but it's not as successful.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sailor
[ENDBLOCK]
Is this the power of the heavens...?
Has the day come for us to return
to the world of the gods?
[ENDBLOCK]
Sailor
[ENDBLOCK]
What's happening right now sounds
like a legend told back home...
[ENDBLOCK]
Sailor
[ENDBLOCK]
What happened to the people
back home? Were they taken
to the world of the gods?
[ENDBLOCK]
Sailor
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm actually from Calvalese.
Did you notice that?
[ENDBLOCK]
Sailor
[ENDBLOCK]
The legends passed down in Calvalese
talk about the Aeth'er Wars.

You sure you wanna spend
your remaining time here?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've already done everything
I need to do.

<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
...I'm sorry you couldn't
see <Dalis> beforehand...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
We may be far apart, but
our hearts remain as one.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Excuse me. That was 
a foolish thing for me
to say.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>, do you think you'll
get married, someday?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Perhaps, someday... For now,
though, it's unthinkable.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, what if...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hm...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, never mind. I'm no good at jokes.
It wouldn't have been funny at all.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's watch the ocean like this...
for just a little while longer...
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah. That sounds good.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character
parameters that can be set. 
The specific method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, press <Square_ani> to 
change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen will be
[Titles]. Press <Triangle_ani> to pick from
all acquired titles.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Titles serve two purposes:
The first is to [affect dialogue 
when talking to NPCs].
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Set a title to have certain NPCs interested
while passing them. When talking with NPCs
multiple times you may get different responses.
Change the title and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to certain NPCs, a [?] will 
appear over the character's head. If this 
happens, set a title that seems to be related
to the dialogue, and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose for titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
