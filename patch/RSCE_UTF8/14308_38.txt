Looks like it's
the same here.
[ENDBLOCK]
Why won't they
buy our lens!?
[ENDBLOCK]
It seems that
rumor was true!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Guys, listen!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
The money transport ship has been delayed. 
The rumor IS true, but please calm down!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
The Oberon Corporation's
money transport broke down.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
There's a replacement on
the way soon, though!
[ENDBLOCK]
Is that true!?
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't believe it!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
The rumors are true,
but please calm down!
[ENDBLOCK]
So it was true after all!
[ENDBLOCK]
Buy my lens first!
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
King <Woodrow>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Everyone, listen. It seems that the
Oberon Corporation's transport
ship ran into some trouble, so it's
running a little behind schedule.
[ENDBLOCK]
Then that rumor
was true after all...
[ENDBLOCK]
If that's the case,
all we can do is wait.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Everyone, please listen.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
The Oberon Corporation
made a mistake and forgot
to schedule a ship to come
here until tomorrow.
[ENDBLOCK]
What!
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah well, no choice
but to wait, then.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is it okay for you
to lie like that?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
This was a last ditch effort
to maintain public order.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I had no other choice... I'd like
to think it was the right one.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lens Shopkeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
Things'll calm down
a bit, for sure.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
That said, I have a feeling this
is going to cause the exchange
rate to become unstable...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll take that over not being able 
to exchange lens at all, though.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The recent uproar has caused

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The lens exchange rate will

[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I certainly don't like to. However,
I couldn't just let <Stahn> lie alone
like that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's going on is troubling
my people, too.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I had no choice, this time.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lens Shopkeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
I believe the lens rate will
stabilize after this, though.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, I guess things
will calm down now.

Was it near the city!?
[ENDBLOCK]

The eethers fear's covered the

I heard that the nearby kingdom
built a HUGE gun to make a hole
in the Eethers...fear.

<TAG_007>Titles serve two purposes:
The first is to [affect dialogue

Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
