Sir, I'm sorry.

[ENDBLOCK]
Older Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you from this city, miss?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Nope. Why?
[ENDBLOCK]
Older Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
I have a... problem
I need help with.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh! A damsel in distress?
Come on, come on, let's
hear it!
[ENDBLOCK]
Older Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay, I'll tell you, then.
[ENDBLOCK]
Older Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
You see, I have a
younger brother.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Really? Well, okay. Go on.
[ENDBLOCK]
Older Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
The other day, I overheard Mom
and Dad talking about him...
[ENDBLOCK]
Older Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
About how he might not
be my real brother...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Really, now...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, let me tell you this.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Even if it's not by blood,
he's still your brother.
[ENDBLOCK]
Older Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't really get it...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Heh. It's kinda tough, eh?
[ENDBLOCK]
Older Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Welp, guess it's yours 
to worry about now!
[ENDBLOCK]
Older Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
You're so mean, miss!
I'm already worried!
[ENDBLOCK]
Older Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey sis!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you okay? Are you
hurt or anything?
[ENDBLOCK]
Older Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah. My brother and I were fine.
[ENDBLOCK]
Older Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
Also, I thought about what 
you said, and I get it now!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well now, you're pretty
smart, huh?
[ENDBLOCK]
Older Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
I was more worried about my brother
than myself when I was running from
the monsters.
[ENDBLOCK]
Older Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
This means we're really
family, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, you got it!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
See? You're not related by blood,
but you're still family!
[ENDBLOCK]
Older Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah!
[ENDBLOCK]
Older Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
Thanks, miss!
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, don't mention it.

Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
Yo, it's been a while!

[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
I think you may have mistaken
me for someone else.
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
Come on, stop jerking my chain. I
want to hear about your travels.
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
You really aren't
him, are you?
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
Sorry about that...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's all right. No harm, no foul.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do I really look that similar
to this gentleman you know?
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, you could be twins.
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
If anyone who knew him saw
you, they would have quite
the reaction.
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
Although last time I saw him, he
sure left town in quite a rush...
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
If you want to know more about
him, you should find his friends.
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
I bet they'd mistake you
for him just like I did.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
You know him, <Philia>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, I don't think I've ever
met this person before.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Um, do I know you?
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Aww, I was wrong...
Sorry, I thought you
were someone else.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, could it be!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you the one
from the letter?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
AAAAAAAAH!
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
What are you doing
here, <Stahn>!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see, the village chief's daughter and
this boy were exchanging letters.
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right. This is the first
time we've met, though.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
So he mistook
<Philia> for you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Man
[ENDBLOCK]
So, let's go somewhere
to relax, shall we?
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
Sure. We don't want to
get in the way of <Stahn>
and his friend.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh. Weird. I feel
a little sad...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why is that?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, a long time ago,
she told me that she
liked me...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, uh, Mr. <Stahn>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
G-Girls tend to forget
the past and move on...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
B-But boys seem 
to always h-hold
onto it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
T-This behavior by men is commonly
di-disliked by wo-women...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, I see. I won't care
about it at all then!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Um, no, but... girls
hate that, too...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you from Calvalese?
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, I am. No need
to whisper.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Well? Gonna make
fun of me or what?
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
No, truth is...
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
I see...
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I forgot... the others
are all over the world,

[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
It ain't much, but take it.

This is the capital city

[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
What's all the fuss about!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, you're that arena fighter.
Mr...Kong...Guy...was it?
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Maybe it's because there are so many
things floating in the sky, but the sun
stays hidden these days.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
The daylight's been completely

Thank you for coming!
Please save this city!

This city only got big by
sucking the money outta
Seinegald!
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
That's what dad said,
so it must be true!
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
He said that this city
grew entirely because
of Seinegald.

[ENDBLOCK]
Whoo! POW!

You guys really did it!
I can't wait to tell dad!

The natives of this city were
undignified savages.

Eek! Help me!
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, you're not
a monster...
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's see what you can
do to those savages!
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I know it wasn't that savage
muscle guy from the arena 
who kept the peace here!
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
All cities are the same
when attacked from
above like that...
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Will humanity have no
choice but to perish?
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I never thought the day would
come when I would be working
with the natives of this city.

The Oberon Corporation is

[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
Someone from this city 
might have been leading
those ruffians!
[ENDBLOCK]
Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
Ms. <Ilene> hasn't been
around for a while.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm worried... That armada was
nothing compared to this!
[ENDBLOCK]
Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
I miss the blue sky.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
I hope one day I can walk in the

Do you know what Softy Kreem is?
It's the specialty of this city.

[ENDBLOCK]
Mommy!?

[ENDBLOCK]
When I tell mom that the <Kongman>
protects the city, she gets really

[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
I heard that a lotta people are
suddenly complaining about the
Oberon Corporation.
[ENDBLOCK]
Child
[ENDBLOCK]
There's a shadow in the sky.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
If it's always nighttime,
I won't have to worry
about sunburns, right?

[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
The climate is nice, and there
is so much to do. This city is
a great place to live.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
I hope this will be a good opportunity
for the residents to get to know each
other a little better.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
As the gap between rich and
poor grew in size, so too did
the animosity the people felt
towards Oberon.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sure Ms. <Ilene>
is disappointed.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
It's times like this that
we need to unite...
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Without Ms. <Ilene>, it would
be very difficult.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
I wanted to show Ms. <Ilene> that
I was working with the residents
of the poor district.
[ENDBLOCK]

If you leave Neustadt and
head north, you will find a

[ENDBLOCK]
Go for that sun!
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
When the sun goes out
of sight, it's a race!
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Race so we can see the sun!
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
You should race that kid. If you
think that's all he is, you're in
for a world of hurt.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
You're asking me if I'm going to gamble
in this situation? I gamble BECAUSE of

Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Titles serve two purposes:
The first is to [affect dialogue 
when talking to NPCs].
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Set a title to have certain NPCs interested
while passing them. When talking with NPCs
multiple times you may get different responses.
Change the title and try talking to them again.

Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to certain NPCs, a [?] will 
appear over the character's head. If this 
happens, set a title that seems to be related
to the dialogue, and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose for titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
