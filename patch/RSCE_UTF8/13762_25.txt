Child
[ENDBLOCK]
The other day, I was on my
way back to the village and
got attacked by a monster.
[ENDBLOCK]
Child
[ENDBLOCK]
I was saved by <Ascus>, one
of the Seven Generals.
[ENDBLOCK]
Child
[ENDBLOCK]
He was actually kind
of a jerk, though...
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
Yo, it's been a while!
How was Seinegald?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I think you may have mistaken
me for someone else.
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
Come on, stop jerking my chain. I
want to hear about your travels.
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
You really aren't
him, are you?
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
Sorry about that...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's all right. No harm, no foul.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do I really look that similar
to this gentleman you know?
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, you could be twins.
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
If anyone who knew him saw
you, they would have quite
the reaction.
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
Although last time I saw him, he
sure left town in quite a rush...
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
If you want to know more about
him, you should find his friends.
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
I bet they'd mistake you
for him just like I did.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Wasn't that big hairy guy
with you the other day?
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Next time you see him,
could you give him this?
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
Aw, why did you get rid of the
braid? It really suited you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Grandson
[ENDBLOCK]
Wow, General <Ashley>!
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
This is <Ashley>, the general
who saved our village.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
General <Ashley> is wonderful!
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder if he'll stay and
live in our village?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>
[ENDBLOCK]
The people of this village,
they're cheering my name!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>
[ENDBLOCK]
They're even calling me, "General
<Ashley>, the savior of the village!"
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't have to wear
a mask anymore!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>
[ENDBLOCK]
The people of this village,
they're cheering my name!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>
[ENDBLOCK]
They're even calling me, "General
<Ashley>, the savior of the village!"
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've finally left my
brother's shadow!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
What do you mean?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh yeah, the king mentioned
your brother, too, didn't he?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>
[ENDBLOCK]
My brother is <Finlay>. The founder
of the Seven Generals.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>
[ENDBLOCK]
He was an amazing man, as
skilled with people as he
was with his blade.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yet as talented as he was,
his life was a short one.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>
[ENDBLOCK]
Because of that, people expected
me to be the same as he was,
rather than my own person.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Uhm... Do you
hate your brother?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>
[ENDBLOCK]
Absolutely not. I adore
him. I worked hard to
live up to his name.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
But you could never
be him exactly, huh?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>
[ENDBLOCK]
As expected, of course. I certainly
wasted a lot of time trying, though.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
In the end, though,
you're your own man.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>
[ENDBLOCK]
Heh, that's nice of you to say.
...Thank you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>
[ENDBLOCK]
For now, I'll continue to
protect this village.
[ENDBLOCK]

<TAG_005><center>Welcome to Armeida.
How about a rest at the inn before
heading out to the temple?
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
This is the village of Armeida,
at the foot of Straylize Temple.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
How horrible!
Oh, Atamoni
preserve us!
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
May you all be blessed
by the Goddess.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Atamoni watches
over our lives
from the temple.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Rumor has it something happened
at the temple. It might be true...
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
I've never seen anything like this
in all my 60 years on this Earth...
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Rumor has it something happened
at the temple. It might be true...
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
What will happen to the
temple from now on?
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
With the help of Bishop <Ayles>, the
reconstruction of the temple seems
to be proceeding smoothly.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
At such times, the blessing
of Atamoni is necessary.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
If we can cooperate, we
can accomplish anything.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you making a pilgrimage
to the Straylize Temple?
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I could tell just by looking at you.
You're loaded like an eggbear!
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Eh? Wait, have I seen
you somewhere before?
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh yeah! You passed through here
to visit Straylize Temple last year!
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
We haven't seen anyone from the
temple for a few days, now...
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Word's already reached us about
what went down at the temple.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Even with <Greybum> gone, it'll
be a while before the temple's
reputation is restored.

[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Such horrifying power...
we're helpless against it!
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
More monsters have been
attacking the village lately.
What are we gonna do!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
All we can do is grit
our teeth and bear it.
[ENDBLOCK]
Kid
[ENDBLOCK]
The village is too quiet.
I wanna go live in the city!
[ENDBLOCK]
Kid
[ENDBLOCK]
Those three came all
the way back here!
They really do care!
[ENDBLOCK]
Kid
[ENDBLOCK]
It might be dangerous
to stay in the city now...
[ENDBLOCK]
Kid
[ENDBLOCK]
At this rate, I'll die before
I get to go to the city...
[ENDBLOCK]
Kid
[ENDBLOCK]
I've decided to stay here after
all. "Home's where the heart is,"
you know?
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
If you're going to Straylize
Temple, take the east road.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
I saw a lot of priests
carrying something big
down the road...
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
What could it have been?
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
It seems fewer people are
visiting the temple, lately.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
A lot of people are visiting
the temple again. They must
be really worried.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm warning pilgrims to steer
clear of the temple for now.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
All it takes is one monster ambush,
and your life is over!
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Good luck!

Huh? You don't have a
Battle Records book?
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
You look strong enough.
Take this.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
It demonstrates the effective monster
killing technique, "Definite Strike."
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Take good care of it.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
You can perform a Definite Strike
by setting [Definite Strike] to "ON"
from the Customize menu in the 
Main menu.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
You can also view each monster's
Definite Strike in the Monster Book
if Definite Strike is "ON."

[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't have anything
else to give you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I have nothing to
say to you now.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Come back when you've
honed your skills more.

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Titles serve two purposes:
The first is to [affect dialogue 
when talking to NPCs].
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Set a title to have certain NPCs interested
while passing them. When talking with NPCs
multiple times you may get different responses.
Change the title and try talking to them again.

Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to certain NPCs, a [?] will 
appear over the character's head. If this 
happens, set a title that seems to be related
to the dialogue, and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose for titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
