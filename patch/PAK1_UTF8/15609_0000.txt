The Draconis was attacked by monsters?
That's a rare occurrence indeed.
[ENDBLOCK]
Is it?
[ENDBLOCK]
Lens may have made them more violent, but those
monsters were once ordinary wild animals.
[ENDBLOCK]
Their instincts wouldn't let them confront an
entity as intimidating as the Draconis.
[ENDBLOCK]
Maybe a beastmaster was controlling them...
[ENDBLOCK]
It is likely that they were being manipulated.
[ENDBLOCK]
Though I have never heard of one
capable of such things. <x00>
